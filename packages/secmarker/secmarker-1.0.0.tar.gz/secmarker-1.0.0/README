# secmarker

Secmarker is a search tool for selenocysteine tRNA (tRNA-Sec) identification. 
The presence of tRNA-Sec in a genome indicates the use of selenocysteine (SeC) by the organism. 
Old version was written in python2 and now it's written in python3

# SECMARKER 0.4

* Web server
  A SecMarker web server is available for online analysis:
  http://secmarker.crg.es/

* Publication
  Didac Santesmasses, Marco Mariotti and Roderic Guigó. Computational identification of the selenocysteine tRNA (tRNASec) in genomes. PLoS Comput Biol. 2017 Feb 13;13(2):e1005383. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005383. 

* Dependencies
  cmsearch and esl-sfetch from the Infernal package (http://infernal.janelia.org/), specifically, version => 1.1 is required.
  RNAplot from ViennaRNA package (http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/), version >= 2.0 is known to work fine.

* Installation:
  In order to use Secmarker run the following comands:

  conda create -y -n secmarker
  conda activate secmarker
  conda install -c bioconda –c matteoserrazanetti secmarker 

* Running secmarker
  usage: secmarker [-h] -t TARGET [-o O] [-plot] [-T T] [-F F] [-cpu CPU]
                    [-cca] [-AT12] [-O O]

  search for selenocysteine tRNA (tRNA-Sec), marker of Sec trait

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -t TARGET, --target TARGET
                          target nucleotide sequence
    -o O                  output folder
    -plot                 generate the tRNA plot(s). For each tRNA prediction,
                          two files (.png and .ps) will be generated in the
                          folder images/
    -T T, --infernal_score T
                          score threshold used by cmsearch (Infernal score)
    -F F, --filtering_score F
                          score threshold used to filter tRNAs. If the tRNA has
                          the UCA anticodon or a G73, -T is used for filtering
    -cpu CPU              number of available CPUs [default 1]
    -cca                  include the 3 residues downstream the discriminator
                          base if available (to check if the CCA sequence is
                        encoded in the sequence)
  -AT12                 force a 12 bp AT-stem, that is a 7/5 fold tRNA
  -O O, --options O     additional options for cmsearch
