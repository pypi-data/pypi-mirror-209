A simple python library that allow you to build swiftUI apps using python.

## How does it work ?
This library works by running python and swift at the same time!. It start a python localhost at the background and run swiftUI app that show the fron-end by communicating with python back-end host. But you should NOT worry about all of that, becuase the library always making sure that everything stay easy, simple and pythonic.
