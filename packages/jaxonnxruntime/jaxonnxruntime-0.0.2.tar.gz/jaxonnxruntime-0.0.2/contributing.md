## How to Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

<!--- Maybe add a bug report template? --->
Bugs are tracked as [Github Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues).
Please explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* Use a clear and descriptive title.
* Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.
* Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.

### Adding Support for New Operators

When running through a new onnx model, you may find that some operators are not implemented in our repository.
This can also be done by running the command:
```shell
$ python tools/analyze_model.py <onnx_model_path>
```
All source code for JAX backend of ONNX operators is located in [jaxonnxruntime/onnx_ops](https://github.com/google/jaxonnxruntime/tree/main/jaxonnxruntime/onnx_ops).
You can generate new template implementation of ONNX operators by running the following command, and then fill in the blanks marked by ```TODO```.
Please do use JAX methods to do the implementation!
```shell
$ python tools/op_code_generator.py <onnx_op_name>
```

After finishing the implementation, please add unit test for the new operator by adding a line
```python
include_patterns.append('test_{op_name_lower}_')
```
to [```tests/onnx_ops_test.py```](https://github.com/google/jaxonnxruntime/blob/main/tests/onnx_ops_test.py).
Then run the unit tests with the following command to make sure it is compatible with both ONNX and JAX.
Make sure all tests are passed before submitting a pull request.
```shell
$ python tests/onnx_ops_test.py
```
