    'long_description': "# umapi-client.py\n\nThis is a Python client for the User Management API from Adobe, aka the\n[UMAPI](https://www.adobe.io/products/usermanagement/docs/gettingstarted.html).\n\nThe User Management API is an Adobe-hosted network service \nwhich provides Adobe Enterprise customers the ability to manage their users.  This\nclient makes it easy to access the UMAPI from a local Python application.\n\nThis client is open source, maintained by Adobe, and distributed under the terms\nof the OSI-approved MIT license.  Copyright (c) 2016-2021 Adobe Inc.\n\n# Installation\n\n`umapi-client.py` is published to the Python Packaging Index.\n\nhttps://pypi.org/project/umapi-client/\n\nIt can be installed with pip:\n\n```\n$ pip install umapi-client\n```\n\nOr a dependency manager such as Poetry:\n\n```\n$ poetry add umapi-client\n```\n\n# Building\n\n[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is required to build the package. Follow the instructions documented on\nPoetry's website to install it on your system.\n\n1. Clone this repository\n   ```\n   $ git clone https://github.com/adobe-apiplatform/umapi-client.py\n   $ cd umapi-client.py\n   ```\n\n2. Install dependencies to virtual environment.\n   ```\n   $ poetry install\n   ```\n\n3. The `build` command will create a source package (`.tar.gz`) and a wheel file (`.whl`) in the `dist` directory.\n   ```\n   $ poetry build\n   $ ls dist\n   umapi-client-2.18.tar.gz  umapi_client-2.18-py3-none-any.whl\n   ```\n\n4. Some of the packages required by this module use encryption, and so may\n   require you to do local builds of modules that use SSL.  Typically, this\n   will require you to have a python installed that supports compiling\n   extensions.\n\n5. Run tests with `pytest`.\n   ```\n   $ poetry run pytest\n   ```\n\n# Usage\n\nUsage documentation, as well as information about how to get client\ncredentials for use of the UMAPI, can be found in the\n[user guide](https://adobe-apiplatform.github.io/umapi-client.py/),\nwhose sources are in the `docs` directory of this repository.\n\n# License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
