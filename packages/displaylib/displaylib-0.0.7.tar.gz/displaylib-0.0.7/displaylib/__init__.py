"""# DisplayLib
----------------

`Requires Python version >= 3.10`

----------------
Submodules:
- template
- ascii (default)
- pygame

----------------
Example using submodules to set mode:
>>> import displaylib.ascii as dl
>>> dl.Node2D() # will be of type ASCIINode
ASCIINode(x, y)

>>> import displaylib.pygame as dl
>>> dl.Node2D() # will be of type PygameNode
PygameNode(x, y)
