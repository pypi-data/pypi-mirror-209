## Introduction

[Astro](https://astro.build/) is the all-in-one web framework designed for speed. This library is supported modes, `static`, `lambda` and `edge`, to deploy astro website to AWS.

## Usage

### Static Hosting

![Static Hosting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helbing/astrojs-aws/main/docs/images/static-hosting.png)

For developing, it's not recommended to deploy with CloudFront, because setup CloudFront is really too slow, at least takes 5min.

```python
from astrojs_aws.construct import StaticAstroSite


site = StaticAstroSite(self, "Site",
    site_dir="/path/to/dist"
)

CfnOutput(self, "Domains",
    value=site.domains.join(", ")
)
```

It's recommended to deploy with CloudFront in production environment.

```python
from astrojs_aws.construct import StaticAstroSite


site = StaticAstroSite(self, "Site",
    site_dir="/path/to/dist",
    cf_options=CfOptions(
        domain="example.com",
        certificate_arn="arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:xxx-xxx-xxx"
    )
)

CfnOutput(self, "Domains",
    value=site.domains.join(", ")
)
```

### Lambda Hosting

![Lambda Hosting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helbing/astrojs-aws/main/docs/images/lambda-hosting.png)

```python
from astrojs_aws.construct import LambdaAstroSite


site = LambdaAstroSite(self, "Site",
    server_entry="/path/to/server/entry.mjs",
    static_dir="/path/to/client"
)

CfnOutput(self, "Domains",
    value=site.domains.join(", ")
)
```

Deploy with CloudFront.

```python
from astrojs_aws.construct import LambdaAstroSite


site = LambdaAstroSite(self, "Site",
    server_entry="/path/to/server/entry.mjs",
    static_dir="/path/to/client",
    cf_options=CfOptions(
        domain="example.com",
        certificate_arn="arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:xxx-xxx-xxx"
    )
)

CfnOutput(self, "Domains",
    value=site.domains.join(", ")
)
```

### Edge Hosting

![Edge Hosting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helbing/astrojs-aws/main/docs/images/edge-hosting.png)

As we known that, edge function working in Edge node. But for developing, setup CloudFront is really too slow. We can only deploy the Lambda function, and use [AWS SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) for testing and debuging.

```python
from astrojs_aws.construct import EdgeAstroSite


EdgeAstroSite(self, "Site",
    server_entry="/path/to/server/entry.mjs",
    static_dir="/path/to/client",
    only_lambda=True
)
```

Deploy to production environment.

```python
from astrojs_aws.construct import EdgeAstroSite


site = EdgeAstroSite(self, "Site",
    server_entry="/path/to/server/entry.mjs",
    static_dir="/path/to/client",
    cf_options=CfOptions(
        domain="example.com",
        certificate_arn="arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:xxx-xxx-xxx"
    )
)

CfnOutput(self, "Domains",
    value=site.domains.join(", ")
)
```
