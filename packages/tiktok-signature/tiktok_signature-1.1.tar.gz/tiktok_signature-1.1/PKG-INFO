    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"
        env_file_encoding = "utf-8"


async def main():
    playwright = await async_playwright().start()
    settings = Settings()
    try:
        server = await make_server(playwright=playwright, host=settings.host, port=settings.port)
        await server.start()
