# copyright-claim

This very simple python package allows to add or remove copyright/license claims at
the beginning of your  source files (single file use or whole folder use, the
files being filtered based on their extensions).

 Yes it has only two functions !


Yet, it also defines a terminal command that allows to call the add and remove functions.



## Installation
This package can be installed with pip as follows.

```
$ pip install copyright-claim
```

Most likely, you need not install this package in a virtual environment,
since its only dependencies are packages which are provided
in the standard library at least since version 3.7 of Python. 



## Documentation

A detailed documentation of this package is available on 
[GitHub Pages](https://completementgaga.github.io/copyright-claim/) --- as a website.

It is also available in pdf format
[here](https://github.com/completementgaga/npGUI/blob/master/sphinx/build/latex/npgui.pdf).

For the command line version, if you used pip to install the package,

you can run 
```
$ copyright-claim -h
```
in your terminal and observe
```
usage: copyright_claim [-h] [--claim_path CLAIM_PATH] [-r] [--extension EXTENSION] [--comment_symbol COMMENT_SYMBOL] {add,remove} project_path
