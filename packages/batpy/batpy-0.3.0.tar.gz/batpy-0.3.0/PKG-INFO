# batpy

`batpy` is a Python wrapper for [Argonne National Laboratory's](https://www.anl.gov) Microsoft Excel-based [software modeling tool BatPaC](https://www.anl.gov/partnerships/batpac-battery-manufacturing-cost-estimation).

## Installation

`batpy` is available from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/batpy/), and currently requires Python 3.10 or newer. It can be installed with:
```bash
$ pip install batpy
```

## Usage and documentation

`batpy` is able to read, write, and calculate batteries in the [BatPaC tool](https://www.anl.gov/partnerships/batpac-battery-manufacturing-cost-estimation). Furthermore, `batpy` can export the calculated batteries to a [`brightway2`](https://pypi.org/project/brightway2/) Excel workbook, which can be imported directly into [`brightway2`](https://pypi.org/project/brightway2/).

Documentation for `batpy` is available at [GitHub Pages](https://rginster.github.io/batpy/), including an example and documentation on all the modules and functions.
