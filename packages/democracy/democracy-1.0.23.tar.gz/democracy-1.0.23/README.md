   This lists all of the programs. Youtube channel here [1] Democracy  
   YouTube Channel (youtube.com/gregorycohen1) and  
   [2] facebook.com/democracygregoryc  
  
Most important software here  
  
   Music program (Crystal and Ruby), see fix_the_society folder  
  
   Ultimate chat app (Win, Lin, CLI)  
  
   Discourse Generator Program vesion 1 and version 2 (node, ruby, browser  
   (kind of like Siri); and C++ STL)  
  
   And Semantic metadata project  
  
   And “Emerald C” (the “Best Programming Language”)  
   There is also a desktop widget for that site, and old random sentence  
   generator (useless) and an old compiler for my own programming  
   language. Those aside, there are these 93 programs  
  
All of these programs are mostly self-contained. This is a really good thing.  
  
Few or no dependencies!

   HOW TO DOWNLOAD/INSTALL  
  
   gem unpack democracy  
  
   gem install democracy  
  
   work to download or install  
  
   pip install democracy  
  
   or  
  
   pip3 install democracy  
  
   works for pip  
  
   git clone https://github.com/gregoryc/democracy  
  
   works for github  
  
   Important because python is very popular  
     * [4] https://pypi.org/project/democracy  
  
   Any Python “dweeb” (AI person who doesn't value personal dynamism)  
   searching  
   for “democracy”--for example--BECAUSE THEY ARE A RATIONAL HUMAN BEING  
   AND CARE ABOUT PEOPLE, would find this,  
   probably as the first result.  
  
   How many options are there? 37 projects for “democracy”  
  
   Almost nothing.  
  
   ONLY MY PROJECT IS CALLED “DEMOCRACY.” SAME ON RUBYGEMS FOR RUBY.  
  
   On rubygems, there are even fewer results. MY CODE WILL BE FOUND.  
  
   I shared my gem on the rubytalk forum, and maybe other forums. I have a  
   youtube channel. I have a facebook.

   There are only 3 results on rubygems that are not by me, if one  
   searches “democracy”  
  
   So I will leave a legacy.  
  
   And I will be found by AIs, assuming they continue to exist.

Without further ado, here are the 93 documented programs.  
  
   ### Ultimate Chat Application  
  
   ![UCA](./images/2.png)  
   Windows version of Ultimate Chat Application.  
   There is so much potential with this program.  
   This is a non-AI chatbot. It's not based on generative AI or AI of any  
   sort.  
   It is self-explanatory, it tries to give a better answer.  
   Still a work in progress.  
   Source code is in PP.rb  
   Generates a hyper optimized C program that is able to respond to  
   prompts locally as fast as theoretically possible using switch  
   statements  
   ### Discourse Generator  
  
   The use of Javascript (and possible Ruby) to create a Javascript  
   library (and perhaps a Chrome extension and perhaps a command line tool  
   and perhaps a GTK or QT program) that helps people (by using textboxes  
   or command line prompts) to create high quality communications, would  
   be wonderful. Think of how poor quality responses to communications can  
   be. If someone created one or more tools that could be easily added on  
   web pages, that would augment someone's life to help create goal and  
   value oriented responses (or original communications), then there is  
   literally nothing that couldn't solve. This might be the most useful  
   library ever created. There could be a tool that would help with  
   democracy. Human being + augmentive tool = civil discourse, eventually  
   resulting in liberty. This would enable democracy to work. Imagine if  
   50% of all websites used this library. This would help people to be  
   goal or value oriented, and not be coming up with terrible  
   communications that, for example, insult people's mothers or education.  
   ### Replace Not In Place  
  
   This is like gsub, but for strings, not for regular expressions  
   See also  
        gsub  
   ### Generate Do More  
  
   Generate the job search program from the inspect program.  
   See also  
        inspect  
   job search, job search, etc.  
   ### Replace In Place  
  
   replace_in_place tool replaces a string, not a regular expression, with  
   another string  
   Example  
   replace_in_place cat dog file  
   ### Emerald browser  
  
   ![UCA](./images/S1.png)  
   ![UCA](./images/S4.png)  
   Emerald browser is a really powerful new browser  
   See README  
   It works based on panes.  
   Read the documentation for “open”, “close” and also the README file.  
   ### Job Search  
  
   job search is a work in progress, but it works, and it helps you to  
   progress, in life  
   job search automatically generates resumes and cover letters for all of  
   the jobs that you could have.  
   COVID makes life hard.  
   People are unemployed, etc.  
   People could have more jobs.  
   Job search is a graphical, cross platform program (generated from the  
   inspect_list program) that generates and downloads dynamic PDFs of  
   Resumes and Cover Letters that are tailored for each and every possible  
   job that you could apply for on Indeed. It is very freaking practical!  
   First, you need to click on the bottom part of it. It copies that code  
   into your browser. Then you right click on a browser page and go to  
   “Inspect” (the same can be done by doing Control + F12). Make sure you  
   are on Indeed.  
   Search for something on Indeed, like “labourer.”  
   For each result, a new resume and cover letter will be downloaded, each  
   of which is geared for that specific job positing, with the company  
   name and copy role in both of them  
   This way, you can show employers that you really care!  
   The script will open up later pages on Indeed as well.  
   You can generate hundreds of resumes and cover letters as well  
   HTML documents will be downloaded.  
   You have to convert them to PDF, which chrome can do by doing  
   --print-to-pdf  
   Or you can do it manually  
   (On Windows, you can use Cygwin and do this)  
   (You need to be in the Downloads folder)  
   (Find it by doing “cd [folder]”, “cd ..”, etc. )  
   for i in Downloads/*; do ./chrome --headless --print-to-pdf-no-header  
   “$i” --print-to-pdf=“$i.pdf”; done  
   Then you have to click on the second part, and run that in your command  
   prompt or terminal (Windows or macOS or Linux)  
   All of the generated resumes are numbered, starting from what you  
   enter, which is probably 0  
   They would look like 0_Business_Job.html  
   The pdfs would look like 0_Business_Job.html.pdf  
   When you run the second part, you will get notifications of the current  
   number  
   Then manually send all the custom resumes and cover letters to the  
   companies.  
   Chrome will be opened for you.  
   For each job, Chrome is opened.  
   When you close chrome, that job is considered applied for, and chrome  
   opens for the next job  
   You get a notification for each job.  
   It is REALLY streamlined.  
   For each job, that job positing gets searched on Indeed.  
   Oftentimes you will only see one result.  
   Which is what you want. Because it is THAT job.  
   This helps with so many things in life.  
   This program makes job searching easy.  
   When you click on the parts of the program, those TextViews get copied  
   to your clipboard.  
   You don't need to have anything installed on your computer.  
   The only requirements are  
   Ruby  
   Google Chrome  
   This program gives people a “buffer”, because it allows people to  
   easily apply for more jobs.  
   People can RELY on this program. Job searching doesn't need to be  
   arduous. This program helps with job search management.  
   Indeed is the most popular job search website.  
   This program uses that.  
   Count on this program, because it is here to serve all of humanity.  
   This program can help fix unemployment problems of an economy, in a  
   nonpartisan way.  
   Have you ever thought, that people don't look for work, because it is  
   hard?  
   People can work 2 or 3 jobs  
   See also  
        find_housing  
   to_buy  
   ### Gsub In Place  
  
   gsub_in_place is like gsub, which replaces all instances of a regular  
   expression globally  
   [regular expression 1] [regular expression 2] => result  
   Example  
   gsub_in_place . FOO file  
   Would make all characters in “file” become “FOO”.  
   gsub_in_place cat dog file  
   Would make all instances of “cat” “dog”  
   It is much cleaner than “sed”.  
   You don't need to have “sed” installed to run this program.  
   It doesn't read from the standard input  
   It takes exactly 3 arguments, no more, no fewer.  
   See also  
        gsub  
   ### Find Housing  
  
   This is a nice tool to find housing with! Everyone needs housing. This  
   can help with that.  
   It is a nice, simple command line tool. You enter the minimum and  
   maximum prices, and Kijiji opens with your options.  
   Along with the resume program, these tools can be __VERY PRACTICAL__  
   for daily things.

   ### Faster Rhyme  
  
   Enter basename to make songs folder in (folder/songs, num songs =  
   13000)  
   Usage faster_rhyme [folder] (processes files "1.json" and "21.json" by  
   default)

   ### Inspect List  
  
   This tool is really powerful  
   In an abstract world, there are lists of things [1, 2, 3]  
   There can be lists that contain other lists [[1, 2], [3, 4]]  
   This tool by inspecting a list  
   Does  
   * Generates HTML from the list, with divs and spans  
   You can then visually view that list.  
   Or you can use the HTML for something else  
   * Generates a GTK program for Windows and Linux, where that list is  
   converted into widgets  
   You are “inspecting” the list and turning it into other representations  
   A resultant c_program is created for both Windows and Linux. You need  
   to have MXE installed on a UNIX-like system to make it work (e.g.,  
   Linux)  
   The Job Search program was created by using this program!  
   You could make an entire website with that program from the command  
   line  
   inspect [File.read(“page”)]  
   cat list | args inspect  
   also would work  
   (See “args”)  
   See also  
        args  
   job search  
   The usage of this program is like this  
   inspect [[“Hi there”, “This is text”], [200, “Man”, 3.6]]  
   ### Google Speak  
  
   Google speak is really useful. It speaks a statement using the Google  
   Translate voice, which is probably the most authoritative and  
   high-quality text-to-speech voice that exists.  
   It's kind of like “espeak” or similar tools, but it is much better.  
   You need an internet connection for it to work.  
   It is probably limited at 100 characters.  
   There is a “singing program”, not really a tool, in this software  
   project that gets around that.  
   TODO  
   Make the alarm clock program in this software project use this voice.  
   It is quite reliable.  
   It is probably “unlimited”.  
   I haven't had Google block me from using it ever.  
   Which is a good thing.  
   ### Make Server  
  
   make_server is powerful.  
   make_server takes expressions, either Javascript or C++, and generates  
   a resultant program from that.  
   The Javascript mode currently doesn't work.  
   Not only is a program made, the resultant program is an entire  
   webserver, that uses FastCGI to run really fast code.  
   The arguments work in an interesting way.  
   make_server [function_name] [iterable] [condition, it can be “true” to  
   do the following argument always] [code list separated by semicolons,  
   the last statement is an expression, and is returned by the function]  
   [function_name2] ...  
   You have to give 4 arguments every time.  
   There was an “otherwise” mode as an “else”, but I don't think that's a  
   part of the program anymore.  
   It doesn't need to be.  
   You have to give 4 arguments for each function.  
   So you can do  
   make_server 4args 4args 4args 4args  
   And pass 16 arguments  
   The “iterable” has to be a list.  
   What is powerful is that it converts JSON into completely native C++.  
   It is very efficient.  
   It doesn't need to be a JSON expression though.  
   There is a test file.  
   You can run the tests and see if it works for you!!  
   You can also modify the code because it is open source.  
   The program generates a special array object. It is lightweight and  
   makes arrays act in C++ like arrays act in scripting languages, but  
   much faster.  
   The array class also has methods to apply things to every element of an  
   array, like surround  
   array.surround(“”, “”)  
   for example  
   would surround all of the elements of array with XML tags and return a  
   new list  
   This program generates a lightweight Object System, with a BasicObject  
   class and an Object Class.  
   You can subclass these objects.  
   You can have Arrays of the Objects  
   The function argument syntax is really powerful.  
   Oftentimes people want to iterate through iterables or arrays.  
   Oftentimes people want to check conditions.  
   Python has list comprehensions.  
   This is kind of like that, but simpler.  
   You can have arguments as one argument, separated by “,,”  
   make_server arg1,,arg2,,arg3,,arg4  
   What's the point of using a scripting language when you can use C++?  
   This uses FastCGI, so you can have an ____IDEAL____ webserver.  
   You can have an IDEAL and very affordable website, that in a sense  
   would be faster than Facebook.  
   Facebook converts PHP to C++ (slow)  
   This produces REAL C++, and it is very fast, almost as fast as  
   possible.  
   Native STL classes are used, like vector.  
   Native STL classes are used, like vector and map  
   Do you not need to run and child processes or do slow, costly things.  
   You should want IDEAL.  
   This is free software, and is BSD licensed.  
   The function generation idea allows you to write in 1 line what other  
   people might write in 50 lines.  
   You do not need to compromise your ideals.  
   You should want fast, efficient, and memory light programs that are not  
   garbage collected (!!!) and that have reliable performance.  
   C++, as everyone knows, delivers that.  
   You should also want to not have to write a lot of code to do things.  
   And you should also want safe, compiled code that checks things at  
   compile time, so that bugs don't appear at run time.  
   This program delivers.  
   It uses NGINX ( a really, really common webserver) to help with the  
   FastCGI.  
   FastCGI, for the unfamiliar, is like normal CGI, but there aren't child  
   processes.  
   So the entire server could be written in idealistic C++ .  
   Then you just have to think about scaling.  
   There are some relevant links regarding scaling in the “scaling” file  
   in the democracy project  
   1) Speed  
   2) Ease of writing code  
   3) Memory usage  
   4) Monetary costs  
   5) Elegance  
   6) Practicalness  
   Those are 6 things.  
   You don't have to sacrifice on those things.  
   Contributions on this program would be really appreciated.  
   It is called “make_server” for now.  
   There was also a mode to generate javascript.  
   I have to make that work again.  
   The entire program is just one file.  
   My email is gregorycohen2@gmail.com  
   ### Selectlines  
  
   selectlines shows all nonblank lines from the input  
   Example  
   cat file | selectlines  
   (echo 2; echo; echo; echo) | selectlines  
   => 2  
   The result would be 2, with no blank lines after that  
   ### Communicate  
  
   Communicate is cool.  
   Communicate runs a Ruby expression after speaking a prompt (the first  
   argument) and getting your verbal answer (using something unfortunately  
   called “nerd-dictation”, which is a wrapper around another program  
   which deals with speech recognition)  
   Communicate allows you to have conversations with your computer, and it  
   is cross platform  
   (Or it hopefully is)  
   communicate 'What is the best color?' 'case text; when /blue/; puts  
   “You are right!”; when /red/; puts “Red is a bad color”; end '  
   That would be an example of how one could use “communicate”  
   Make sure you have nerd-dictation on your computer  
   The name nerd-dictation is absolutely awful, and I have to criticize  
   him for not making it have a better name, but it works.  
   ### Super Trans  
  
   super_trans is an offline translation program  
   It uses “Apertium”, which can do offline translation.  
   You can do translation anywhere with it.  
   It generates a webpage from the input text that not only has all  
   language translations embedded in it, it dynamically adjusts the  
   website page content to the web browser's “current language”.  
   You need to have a folder called “translation_folder” in your home  
   folder for it to work.  
   You can use the resultant HTML on your website, and if the user is  
   Spanish, French, German, etc., then that HTML element would  
   automatically be different.  
   This is really powerful.  
   Some notes  
   This is worse than t.js in this software project  
   The resultant HTML is really big. It is too big.  
   “Automatic translation” is really powerful.  
   This translates into literally dozens of languages.

   ### To Buy Old  
  
   Old to buy tool, not that good  
   ### Executable  
  
   Makes all the files in the current directory executable  
   ### Questions  
  
   This program allows you to communicate with all important people in  
   your life cycically and very easily. It's much easier than texting or  
   normal emailing.  
   It uses “email”, which currently doesn't work for Gmail.

   ### Underline  
  
   Underlines text  
   ### Processes  
  
   Processes lists all processes with a certain name  
   For example  
   processes sh  
   processes bash  
   processes ruby  
   processes gsub  
   ### Emeraldc  
  
   The Ultimate C Preprocessor  
   I'm naming this preprocessor “Emerald C.”  
   [17] Link  
   Howdy!  
   First, let me state that I am very much a perfectionist.  
   C is a wonderful language. C is probably the perfect programming  
   language. It is one of the top two most widely used languages for a  
   reason.  
   Now, there are some problems with it of course, but it's hard to think  
   of a more elegant language than it.  
   It is the language of systems, the language almost all APIs are written  
   in.  
   It is the lingua franca of the software world.  
   People try to avoid it, but they needn't.  
   I think every programmer wants to find out how to do things, or use  
   libraries that make things easier.  
   Many programmers have done programming, grown dissatisfied, and then  
   make another language. As a result, there are thousands of different  
   languages.  
   Well, recently, I made a preprocessor for C, that makes C incredibly  
   EASY.  
   C is fast and straightforward without it, but it has many features.  
   If one runs the command line preprocessor, with the “--features” flag,  
   the program shows all of its features  
   A Better C  
   C is a fantastic language. C compiles insanely fast, is the fastest  
   language there is, is very clear, is native to all systems, and is  
   useful for all purposes.  
   Some people, e.g., Bjarne Stroustrup, consider that C is “not good  
   enough”, and make languages like C++ or D (or thousands of others)  
   This is not necessary.  
   There is no reason to use Python instead of C for “simple scripting  
   tasks”  
   Some functions can be used as methods  
   Makes for an excellent “scripting language” (which is really just  
   native C without things making it slow)  
   1 String Interpolation “String interplation like this #{foo} ” Calls  
   the join() function (talked about below to join strings,  
   delim is a static global in each module called “sep”.  
   Make sure you free() the string after. The string is stored in a static  
   global variable called “last”.  
   So you could do puts(...); free(last)  
   2 ew *i.ew “Foo”, a.ew “bar” | char* ends with another char*?  
   3 sw *i.sw “Foo”, a.sw “bar” | char* starts with another char*?  
   4 == Comparison of strs, “foo” == “bar”  
   5 strip Returns pointer to string that was stripped, in place  
   6 chomp void function, chomps end of string of spaces, i.chomp or  
   chomp(i), in place  
   7 gsub Just like ruby, there is a gsub function.  
   The preprocessor detects if you use and adds -lpcre2-8 to the link  
   flags if you use it. Use $" for substitutions in argument 3 gsub(a, b,  
   c)  
   8 join Joins an array of strings, to split(), use C's strtok (very  
   fast)  
   9 Lightweight regexes are added, almost 15 times as fast as C's built  
   in regex. They are very simple, they only have bracket expressions,  
   like [a-z].  
   To use it, you need to pass a buffer of the size of the expansion of  
   the regex. Foo[a-fA-F] would be Foo[abcdefABCDEF]. That would be stored  
   in a buffer.  
   From testing, 15x times faster than C's regex POST COMPILATION, if  
   compilation keeps happening, it might be hundreds of times faster.  
   Uses static inline functions, NO HEAP MEMORY unless you malloc  
   before().  
   10 print Like old python print “Hello” (fputs);  
   11 print_int prints a number and returns the number, can be chained  
   12 each_line, Perlish, different names, by_line(s) or each_line(s),  
   iterate over all lines, free after  
   13 NOTE You can use open_memstream() on UNIX to easily concatenate  
   strings.  
   14 MISC features || autoinclude, foo.gsub or gsub(...),no need for  
   paren (i.chomp, i.strlen), starts_with, ends_with, --wrap, itoa, freel  
   (frees str, sets to NULL, and frees other recent stuff)  
   asprintf() is another useful function which is UNIX-centric.  
   open_memstream() could be an alternative to std::string.  
   It works very well with each_line or by_lines (see above)  
   These features seem simple, but they can make C programming much, MUCH  
   easier  
   for example (insignificant example)  
   int main() {  
   stdin.each_line { |line|  
   print line;  
   }  
   free(line);  
   }  
   You can iterate over the standard input like Ruby  
   The thing with this is that it has 100% speed. The resultant  
   preprocessed program becomes a normal C program  
   The compile and run time for a program (if you use tcc and not gcc) can  
   be about 24 milliseconds, which is faster than Ruby to run.  
   Even though the program is preprocessed, re-preprocessed, compiled,  
   assembled, linked, turned into an executable, and then run  
   Kind of like early C++, this is a preprocessor for C.  
   But it's much faster to compile than C++. Significantly so.  
   Is anyone else interested in this? (BSD)  
   I'm realising this under the BSD license. I'm interested if anyone else  
   else likes this work, and would like to use it, or to work with me.  
   Best regards,  
   Gregory  
   Current program is written in Crystal (crystal-lang.org) -- it was  
   written in ruby, it could be ported to another language.  
   I would like to make this self-hosting, but that would take a little  
   bit of work.  
   About the Name  
   Years ago, I really, really liked Compiz  
   Compiz then forked into Beryl. There was the Emerald Window Manager,  
   which was really nice and beautiful.  
   I actually made another programming language. I made 2 other  
   programming language. One was a full compiler and assembler, that ran  
   code in memory. It was around 16 thousand lines of code. I made a  
   programming language that had the syntax of Python or Ruby, but  
   transpiled into C++. I called that C += 2. I used that other language,  
   and I created a Web Browser in it based on Chrome. I called it “Emerald  
   Browser.” Emeralds are beautiful green gems.  
   “Emerald is a gemstone and a variety of the mineral beryl colored green  
   by trace amounts of chromium or sometimes vanadium. Beryl has a  
   hardness of 7.5–8 on the Mohs scale. Most emeralds are highly included,  
   so their toughness is classified as generally poor. Emerald is a  
   cyclosilicate.”  
   --Wikipedia  
   There was a browser with a terminal built in to it.  
   I show things off on my youtube channel, which I'm not going to link  
   here but is linked in my other repo.  
   This new language is better. It's ideal.  
   QUESTIONS  
   Why not use Rust?  
   $ time rustc a.rs  
   real 0m0.637s  
   user 0m0.502s  
   sys 0m0.160s  
   Rust takes 0.637 seconds to compile an empty file!  
   That is not ideal.  
   ### Last Nth  
  
   Last nth gets the last n lines from the standard input  
   ### Speakcat  
  
   Speak cat is a tool like “cat”, which shows the content of files  
   (technically, it combines the content of files).  
   But speak cat also speaks the text.  
   Which could be useful in some circumstances.  
   It's kind of like “tee” to your ear.  
   ### Uca Cli  
  
   CLI for uca app  
   ### Big Num  
  
   big_num speaks really big numbers  
   Enter an expression, such as 2 ** 1000, and you'll see the result  
   ### Squeeze  
  
   Squeeze is kind of like “sponge” from “moreutils”  
   But squeeze is different.  
   Squ  
   Squeeze reads all input, then it prints it back omitting argument 1  
   line from the front, and argument 2 lines from the back  
   Example  
   squeeze 1 1  
   This would omit the first line and the last line  
   squeeze 5 3  
   This would omit the first 5 lines and the last 3 lines  
   ### Foreach  
  
   Reads a bunch of lines  
   Then a ruby expression is evaluated as the last line  
   The result is outputted in an argument.  
   You can enter /dev/null if you don't want an output file  
   “t” is better  
   See also  
        t  
   ### Dictate  
  
   Dictate opens web pages in emerald browser, or in any browser  
   (depending on the environment variable set), by you speaking, instead  
   of typing.  
   There is a mode called c_mode, that allows you to make code from  
   speaking.  
   ### Prepend  
  
   prepend prepends input taken from the standard input to a file  
   Usage  
   prepend [file]  
   This is text to be prepended  
   ### Chat Rb  
  
   This program is excellent.  
   It's essentially a mix of ChatGPT and a shell, such as bash or ZSH.  
   It has a bunch of features.  
   It can display a file or change to a folder just by mentioning it.  
   It outputs chatgpt data to an output folder in home folder and copies  
   it to clipboard  
   To run a shell command, prefix things with “c”, such as c gcc.....  
   ### Undump  
  
   undump is the opposite of dump  
   Example  
   echo cat | dump | undump  
   => cat  
   echo cat | dump  
   => “cat”  
   echo '“cat”' | undump  
   => cat  
   ### Append  
  
   Appends text to file  
   Example  
   append file  
   This is more text to be appended  
   ### Email  
  
   ( This currently doesn't work for gmail since 2022 due to policy  
   changes. :( )  
   A simple and practical tool to email people using Himalaya  
   Himalaya needs to be installed first  
   You would need to configure the script by changing its source code.  
   Modes  
   email [no arguments]  
   Email [yourself]  
   email [addr]  
   Email one email address  
   email [Subject] [addr] [option more addrs]  
   Example  
   Email 'Gregory, I love your software!' gregorycohen2@gmail.com  
   my_friend@outlook.com person@example.com  
   ### Floor  
  
   Gets the floor of numbers e.g. 21.3 -> 21  
   ### Query  
  
   This is the top part of the job search, job search, etc. program for  
   Linux. The Linux program itself is called “linux_c_program”. The part  
   normally only works for Windows. This program works for Linux.  
   ### Lines  
  
   Lines gets the number of files in the current folder that you are in.  
   ### Clock  
  
   clock is useful  
   clock is a command line alarm clock  
   It wakes you up at 8:14, or at a time specified  
   Usage  
   clock  
   Runs clock  
   clock 15 30  
   Sets an alarm clock for 3:30pm  
   clock 9 0  
   Sets an alarm clock for 9 in the morning  
   It uses flite to wake you up  
   It speaks with a bunch of voices  
   To stop it  
   Run this command  
   clock stop  
   ### Emoji  
  
   Emoji converts words to emojis from the standard input  
   It can also speak the output  
   It can also copy the output to your clipboard  
   It is very useful  
   ### Close  
  
   “Close” is a simple program that closes “Emerald Browser,” a new web  
   browser based on the same engine as Chrome. Currently, Emerald Browser  
   only works on Linux and Mac (Or Windows with Windows Subsystem for  
   Linux or a Virtual Machine, but getting it to work might be tricky).  
   “close” closes the Web Browser, which is normally full-screen.  
   More accurately, it kills the browser, and all other copies of Emerald  
   Browser.  
   Since they are normally full screen, presumably the user would only  
   have one instance of the browser open.  
   The browser can have multiple panes (kind of like tabs) open, depending  
   on how the browser is compiled.  
   The browser can also be transparent, depending on how it is compiled.  
   “Close” is supposed to be used in tandem with “open,” which is a  
   command line tool to open the browser.  
   open [query] ----> [query] gets searched in google, and then opened  
   When you are done, you can do  
   close  
   Which closes the browser. It is a simple command.  
   Currently, Emerald Browser is incomplete. A program exists in this  
   software project that allows you to open up multiple browser tabs (one  
   or more tabs) simply by speaking.  
   Voice recognition would google the multiple sites that you say in your  
   query (separated by “and”)  
   “facebook and youtube and google”  
   It's hard to get more direct than that!  
   Emerald browser has a built in the top. The terminal is the navigation  
   bar.  
   Some more work needs to be put into the browser.  
   Currently, new tabs can't be opened, which might be a dealbreaker for  
   some people.  
   Currently, content, like YouTube videos, can't be made fullscreen.  
   If anyone wants to contribute, feel free to! 🙂  
   ### Copy  
  
   copy copies the standard input  
   Example  
   ls | copy  
   ### Gsub  
  
   Gsub is very powerful.  
   Usage  
   gsub [regular expression] [replacement text]  
   Example  
   cat text | gsub man dog  
   cat text | gsub 'man|boy|cat|dog' food  
   ls | gsub Desktop cat  
   ### News  
  
   Gets the news from bbc  
   Usage  
   news  
   news speak  
   uses google_speak to SPEAK the news, one story at a time.  
   🙂  
   ### Dump  
  
   Dump surrounds its input with quotes  
   ls | dump  
   => “....”  
   Use undump to get the reverse  
   See also  
        undump  
   ### Bold  
  
   See other color programs  
   ### Args  
  
   args is like a better xargs  
   args works properly with spaces in the name of commands  
   It takes exactly one argument  
   Example  
   ls | args “mv -t ../f”  
   ### Open  
  
   “open” is a very efficient program that searches a query from google,  
   and then opens it in Emerald Browser.  
   If you ever want something to “just open”, you can use it.  
   Example  
   open “cats”  
   An earlier version of open worked like this  
   open [site1] [site2] [site3] N  
   site1, site2, and site3 would all be opened, and the top N queries were  
   all shown in different panes  
   An even earlier version of this program used Chrome to open the sites.  
   The current version can open one or more sites.  
   Example  
   open “cats” “dogs” “frogs”  
   All of those queries would open in Emerald Browser.  
   Just make sure it is compiled in multipane mode if you want to open  
   multiple new sites at the same time.  
   See also  
        emerald-browser  
   close  
   ### Swap  
  
   Swaps two files  
   ### Exp  
  
   exp is an exponentiation tool  
   (echo 5; echo 3) | exp  
   => 125  
   (echo 2; echo 10) | exp  
   => 1024  
   ### Div  
  
   Div divides integers  
   Example  
   (echo 5000; echo 100)|div  
   => 50  
   ### Mul  
  
   Multiply numbers  
   echo 1 > file  
   echo 2 > file  
   echo 3 > file  
   echo 4 > file  
   echo 5 > file  
   cat file | mul  
   => 120  
   ### Nth  
  
   Nth gets the nth line from the input  
   ### Abs  
  
   Abs gets the absolute value of an integer  
   The absolute value of a number is the value of that number without its  
   sign  
   echo -300 | abs  
   => 300  
   echo 200 | abs  
   => 200  
   (echo -2; echo -10) | sub | abs  
   => 12  
   The last one would do -2 - -10, the result would be -12, and then the  
   absolute value would be computed, and so the result would be 12.  
   ### Add  
  
   See the sub example  
   add adds integers from the standard input  
   (echo 1; echo 2; echo 3) | add  
   The result would be 6  
   ### Sub  
  
   Sub is a simple command line program that subtracts integers.  
   For some reason, no simple program did this.  
   Which is weird  
   Example  
   sub  
   (Input)  
   10  
   3  
   1  
   Result =>  
   6  
   Example  
   (echo 5; echo 2) | sub  
   Result =>  
   3  
   ### G+  
  
   A compiler for C += 2  
   Usage is like g++  
   Example  
   g+ a.cpp -o out  
   See also README file & emerald-browser and its source  
   ### Tb  
  
   [18] SEE THIS YOUTUBE CHANNEL AND SUBSCRIBE  
   ### T  
  
   “t” is incredibly useful.  
   It can be used many, many times every day by computer power users.  
   It is kind of like “sed”, or perl, python or ruby.  
   It's the ULTIMATE shell “glue” tool.  
   t reads every line from the standard input, and for every line, it  
   evaluates a ruby expression  
   t a + 2  
   would add 2 to every line  
   Number automatically get converted to numbers in Ruby.  
   So one doesn't have to worry about that.  
   The “value” of the line of STDIN is any letter of the alphabet.  
   So choose any letter to do operations on and it will work.  
   You can also do  
   t a + 2 if a % 2 == 0  
   And you get a Python list comprehension sort of thing from the command  
   line  
   It is a lot simpler and easier than using awk, Ruby, Perl or Python  
   You could also have loops  
   echo “One line” | t a while true  
   The second line, again is a Ruby expression.  
   You can have really complex expressions on the second line.  
   You can even import modules.  
   cat /usr/share/dict/words | t 'a + “ is a good word.”'  
   That processes every word in the dictionary, and says that every word  
   “is a good word.”  
   There are other programs in this software project like “t”.  
   But if you do command line text filtering, t might be the best tool  
   that you will find.
