# cemd_metasurf
Coupled electric and magnetic dipole (CEMD) librery for calculating optical properties of metasurfaces.

The current version can calculate reflexion and transmision for lattices with one particle per unit cell. In future releases it is planning to add new functionalities as:

- More than one particles per unit cell.
- Near field calculation (with periodicity along the lattice).
- Local density of states and near field for dipole exitation.
- Presence of layered ubstrate.
