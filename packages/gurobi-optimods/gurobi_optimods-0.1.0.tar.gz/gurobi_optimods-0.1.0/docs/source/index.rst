Welcome to Gurobi OptiMods's documentation!
===========================================

**Gurobi OptiMods**: nice APIs for common optimization tasks.

``gurobi-optimods`` is an open-source Python repository of implemented
optimization use cases, each with clear, informative, and pretty documentation
that explains how to use it and the mathematical model behind it.

The package is a collection of independent 'mods'. Each mod is intended to be
immediately applicable to real use-cases. However, we expect that for many
practical applications users will need to understand and extend the
implementation of a mod to tailor it to their use-case. Read the :doc:`usage`
section first for an overview of the design and use-case for the OptiMods.

Check out :doc:`gallery` for a quick overview of the current set of implemented
mods. We welcome contributions of use-cases you are interested in, or extensions
to existing mods. See :doc:`contributing` and :doc:`extending` for more
information on how to get involved in the project.
