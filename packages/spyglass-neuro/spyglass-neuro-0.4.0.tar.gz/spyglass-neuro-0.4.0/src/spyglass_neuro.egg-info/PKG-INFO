# spyglass

`spyglass` is a data analysis framework that facilitates the storage, analysis, visualization, and sharing of neuroscience data to support reproducible research. It is designed to be interoperable with the NWB format and integrates open-source tools into a coherent framework.

Documentation can be found at - [https://lorenfranklab.github.io/spyglass/](https://lorenfranklab.github.io/spyglass/)

## Installation

For installation instructions see - [https://lorenfranklab.github.io/spyglass/type/html/installation.html](https://lorenfranklab.github.io/spyglass/type/html/installation.html)

## Tutorials

The tutorials for `spyglass` is currently in the form of Jupyter Notebooks and can be found in the [notebooks](https://github.com/LorenFrankLab/spyglass/tree/master/notebooks) directory. We strongly recommend opening them in the context of `jupyterlab`.
