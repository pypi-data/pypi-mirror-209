    K-Nearest Neighbours

    

predict: Returns the predicted value
    

visualize: Returns  a matplotlib scatter plot of the data along with the predicted point and its value. (Requires the calling of predict() method first)
    

euclidean: Returns the Euclidean distance of the given point from all the points given in the dataset
    
    


Linear Regression

    

fit: Trains the model to the given data and return the slope and intercept values
    

predict: Returns the predicted value
