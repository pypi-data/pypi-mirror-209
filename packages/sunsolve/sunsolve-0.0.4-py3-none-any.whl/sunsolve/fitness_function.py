# fit_sum calculates the sum of fitness values between all the specified bins
def fit_sum(fits_per_bin):
    """This is a function that uses a normalized normal disctribution to add a weighted score to how close the LED simulation is to each
    bin of the solar spectrum. The normal distribution is fitted around a mean of 1, which when using a standard deviation of 0.35, would
    give a maximum score of 1 per bin (ie: a bin with 50% or 150% of the power of the solar spectrum has a score of 0.36). Therefore if
    there are 10 bins, the maximum score is 10 (perfect fit), and the lowest score is 0.
