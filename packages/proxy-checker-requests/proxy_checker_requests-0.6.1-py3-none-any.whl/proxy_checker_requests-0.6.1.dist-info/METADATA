# Proxy Checker (Python)

[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/proxy-checker-requests)](https://pepy.tech/project/proxy-checker-requests)

A proxy checker in Python using Requests.

## Description

The proxy checker takes a proxy as input and uses it to send a request to a proxy judge (a website that outputs the information that was sent to it). If the request succeeds, the proxy checker will use the information it receives from the proxy judge to determine the proxy's:

- Country
- Protocol
- Anonymity
- Speed

## Installation

```console
pip install proxy-checker-requests
```

## Usage

```python3
from proxy_checker import ProxyChecker

checker = ProxyChecker()
checker.check_proxy('<ip>:<port>')
```

```json
{
  "country": "United States",
  "country_code": "US",
  "protocols": ["socks4", "socks5"],
