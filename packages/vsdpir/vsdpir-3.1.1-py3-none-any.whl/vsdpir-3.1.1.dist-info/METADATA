# DPIR
Plug-and-Play Image Restoration with Deep Denoiser Prior, based on https://github.com/cszn/DPIR.


## Dependencies
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started) >=2.0.1
- [VapourSynth](http://www.vapoursynth.com/) >=R60

`trt` requires additional runtime libraries:
- [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) 11.8
- [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) 8.9
- [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) >=8.6.1.6

For ease of installation on Windows, you can download the 7z file on [Releases](https://github.com/HolyWu/vs-dpir/releases) which contains required runtime libraries and Python wheel file. Either add the unzipped directory to your system `PATH` or copy the DLL files to a directory which is already in your system `PATH`. Finally pip install the Python wheel file.


## Installation
```
pip install -U vsdpir
python -m vsdpir
```


## Usage
```python
from vsdpir import dpir

ret = dpir(clip)
```

See `__init__.py` for the description of the parameters.
