The functionality here\nis low level and intended to support the development of other\ntools. If you just want to build a geneagraph, take a look at\n[Geneagrapher](https://github.com/davidalber/geneagrapher). If you\nwant to get mathematician records and use them in code, then this\nproject may be useful to you.\n\n## Documentation\nDocumentation about how to call into this package's functions can be\nfound at http://geneagrapher-core.readthedocs.io/.\n\n## Development\nDependencies in this package are managed by\n[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). Thus, your Python environment\nwill need Poetry installed. Install all dependencies with:\n\n```sh\n$ poetry install\n```\n\nSeveral development commands are runnable with `make`:\n- `make fmt` (also `make black` and `make format`) formats code using\n  black\n- `make format-check` runs black and reports if the code passes\n  formatting checks without making changes\n- `make lint` (also `make flake8` and `make flake`) does linting\n- `make mypy` (also `make types`) checks the code for typing violations\n- `make test` runs automated tests\n- `make check` does code formatting (checking, not modifying),\n  linting, type checking, and testing in one command; if this command\n  does not pass, CI will not pass\n",
