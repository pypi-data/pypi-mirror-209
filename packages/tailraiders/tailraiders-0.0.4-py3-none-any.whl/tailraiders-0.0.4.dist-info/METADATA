# Tailraiders
Tailraiders is a package currently **under development**. It is meant to be used for school and potentially later for Data Science. Modeled after the Tailraiders Alliance Factions, all subpackages are named after those.

## Installation
You can install the package by using the following code:<br>
**pip install tailraiders**

## New additions: Version 0.0.4
- All functionalities can be imported from tailraiders, no need for calling the subpackages at this point in time
- docstring function now has inputs
- Plot now has an additional child-class: MeltPlot
- Nan is moved to tailraiders.protector
- Nan now has a function to read from csv-files: df_from_file
