class MaskRCNN(nn.Module):
    """
    Implements Mask R-CNN.
    The input image to the model is expected to be a tensor, shape [C, H, W], and should be in 0-1 range.
    The behavior of the model changes depending if it is in training or evaluation mode.
    During training, the model expects both the input tensor, as well as a target (dictionary),
    containing:
        - boxes (FloatTensor[N, 4]): the ground-truth boxes in [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax] format, with values
          between 0-H and 0-W
        - masks (UInt8Tensor[N, H, W]): the segmentation binary masks for each instance
    The model returns a Dict[Tensor], containing the classification and regression losses
    for both the RPN and the R-CNN, and the mask loss.
    During inference, the model requires only the input tensor, and returns the post-processed
    predictions as a Dict[Tensor]. The fields of the Dict are as
    follows:
        - boxes (FloatTensor[N, 4]): the predicted boxes in [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax] format,
          with values between 0-H and 0-W
        - labels (Int64Tensor[N]): the predicted labels
        - scores (FloatTensor[N]): the scores for each prediction
        - masks (FloatTensor[N, H, W]): the predicted masks for each instance, in 0-1 range. In order to
          obtain the final segmentation masks, the soft masks can be thresholded, generally
          with a value of 0.5 (mask >= 0.5)

    Arguments:
        backbone (nn.Module): the network used to compute the features for the model.
        num_classes (int): number of output classes of the model (including the background).

        rpn_fg_iou_thresh (float): minimum IoU between the anchor and the GT box so that they can be
            considered as positive during training of the RPN.
        rpn_bg_iou_thresh (float): maximum IoU between the anchor and the GT box so that they can be
            considered as negative during training of the RPN.
        rpn_num_samples (int): number of anchors that are sampled during training of the RPN
            for computing the loss
        rpn_positive_fraction (float): proportion of positive anchors during training of the RPN
        rpn_reg_weights (Tuple[float, float, float, float]): weights for the encoding/decoding of the
            bounding boxes, for the four parameters.
        rpn_pre_nms_top_n_train (int): number of proposals to keep before applying NMS during training
        rpn_pre_nms_top_n_test (int): number of proposals to keep before applying NMS during testing
        rpn_post_nms_top_n_train (int): number of proposals to keep after applying NMS during training
        rpn_post_nms_top_n_test (int): number of proposals to keep after applying NMS during testing
        rpn_nms_thresh (float): NMS threshold used for postprocessing the RPN proposals

        box_fg_iou_thresh (float): minimum IoU between the proposals and the GT box so that they can be
            considered as positive during training of the classification head
        box_bg_iou_thresh (float): maximum IoU between the proposals and the GT box so that they can be
            considered as negative during training of the classification head
        box_num_samples (int): number of proposals that are sampled during training of the
            classification head
        box_positive_fraction (float): proportion of positive proposals during training of the
            classification head
        box_reg_weights (Tuple[float, float, float, float]): weights for the encoding/decoding of the
            bounding boxes
        box_score_thresh (float): during inference, only return proposals with a classification score
            greater than box_score_thresh
        box_nms_thresh (float): NMS threshold for the prediction head. Used during inference
        box_num_detections (int): maximum number of detections, for all classes.
