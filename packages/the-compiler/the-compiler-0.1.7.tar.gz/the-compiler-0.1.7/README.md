# The-Compiler
Seed, Code, Harvest: Grow Your Own App with Tree of Thoughts!

![the-compiler](the-compiler.png)

Welcome to _The Compiler_, a novel child project under the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) paradigm. [Implementation here](https://github.com/kyegomez/tree-of-thoughts) This project is crafted with the intent of making autonomous programming not just a reality, but an effortless task for you. 

In essence, _The Compiler_ allows you to "grow" any program you can dream of. By providing a high-level specification of the product you would like, you can sit back and let _The Compiler_ do the heavy lifting.

## Overview 

_The Compiler_ leverages the ToT framework and large language models (LLMs) to handle the programming process, from abstract specifications to a working program. 

Here's a basic breakdown of the workflow:

1. **Input**: You provide an abstract specification for the product you would like.
2. **Unit Tests Generation**: We use an LLM on ToT to produce a suite of unit tests for the code.
3. **Run ToT**: We run the Tree of Thoughts LLM on the given specification, using the generated unit tests as the evaluation score.
4. **Output**: Ready to use program!


# Usage
Get started: 

```git clone https://github.com/kyegomez/the-compiler.git ```

and or 

``` pip install tree-of-thoughts```

```pip install the-compiler```

2nd step
``` cd the-compilerÂ ```

3rd step
Create an file called config_json.json and put this inside:

```json
{
    "allow_terminal_execution": true
}
```

4th step -- create an new file and place this inside
``` python

from tree_of_thoughts import OptimizedOpenAILanguageModel
from the_compiler import TerminalExecutor, TheCompiler

# Initialize the LLM
api_key = "api key"
LLM = OptimizedOpenAILanguageModel(api_key)

# Initialize the TerminalExecutor
terminal_executor = TerminalExecutor(config_file="config_file.json")

# Initialize The Compiler with the LLM and TerminalExecutor
compiler = TheCompiler(LLM, terminal_executor)

# Example usage
input_spec = "Create a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division"
k = 5
T = 3
b = 5
vth = 0.5
timeout = 10
confidence = 0.9
max_iterations = 5
convergence_threshold = 0.01
convergence_count = 5

# Call the compile method with the input problem and other params
solution = compiler.compile(input_spec, k, T, b, vth, timeout, confidence_threshold=confidence, max_iterations=max_iterations, convergence_threshold=convergence_threshold, convergence_count=convergence_count)

# Use the solution
print(f"solution: {solution}")

# Extract terminal commands from the solution
terminal_commands = re.findall(r"TerminalCommand: (.+)", solution)

# Execute terminal commands
for command in terminal_commands:
    output = terminal_executor.execute(command)
    if output:
        print(f"Command output: {output}") #

```


## Architecture

The Compiler, leveraging the Tree of Thoughts paradigm, consists of several primary components, including the Specification Parser, Thought Decomposer, Thought Generator, State Evaluator, and the Search Algorithm. 

1. **Specification Parser**: This interprets your high-level input specifications and translates them into a format that the Thought Decomposer can understand and work with.

2. **Thought Decomposer**: This component breaks down the programming problem into manageable "thoughts" or steps.

3. **Thought Generator**: It generates potential thoughts or steps from the current state using two strategies, either sampling thoughts independently or proposing thoughts sequentially.

4. **State Evaluator**: It evaluates the progress of different states towards solving the programming problem, acting as a heuristic for the Search Algorithm.

5. **Search Algorithm**: This module determines which states to keep exploring and in which order. It employs either Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS), depending on the nature of the problem.
