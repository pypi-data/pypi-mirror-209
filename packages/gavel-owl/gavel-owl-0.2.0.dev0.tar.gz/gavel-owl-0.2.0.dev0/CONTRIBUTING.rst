Bug reports
===========

When `reporting a bug <https://github.com/gavel-tool/python-gavel-owl/issues>`_ please include:

    * Your operating system name and version.
    * Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
    * Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

Documentation improvements
==========================

gavel-owl could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official gavel-owl docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

Feature requests and feedback
=============================

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/gavel-tool/python-gavel-owl/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that code contributions are welcome :)

Development
===========

To set up `python-gavel-owl` for local development:

1. Fork `python-gavel-owl <https://github.com/gavel-tool/python-gavel-owl>`_
   (look for the "Fork" button).
2. Build java endpoint

  a) If `make` is available on your system: `make`
  b) Otherwise: ::

    cd java
    mvn package
    cp ..
    cp java/target/java-1.0-SNAPSHOT.one-jar.jar src/gavel_owl/jars/api.jar

3. Clone your fork locally::

    git clone git@github.com:gavel-tool/python-gavel-owl.git

4. Create a branch for local development::

    git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes run all the checks and docs builder with `tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_ one command::

    tox

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    git add .
    git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

If you need some code review or feedback while you're developing the code just make the pull request.

For merging, you should:

1. Include passing tests (run ``tox``) [1]_.
2. Update documentation when there's new API, functionality etc.
3. Add a note to ``CHANGELOG.rst`` about the changes.
4. Add yourself to ``AUTHORS.rst``.

.. [1] If you don't have all the necessary python versions available locally you can rely on Travis - it will
       `run the tests <https://travis-ci.org/gavel-tool/python-gavel-owl/pull_requests>`_ for each change you add in the pull request.

       It will be slower though ...

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

    tox -e envname -- pytest -k test_myfeature

To run all the test environments in *parallel*::

    tox -p auto
