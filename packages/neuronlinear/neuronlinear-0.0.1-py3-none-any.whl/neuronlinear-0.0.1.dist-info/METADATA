# Perceptron Package - neuronlinear



![Perceptron](https://images.deepai.org/glossary-terms/perceptron-6168423.jpg)

Welcome to the neuronlinear ! This package is designed to provide a simple and efficient implementation of the Perceptron algorithm for binary classification tasks. Whether you are new to machine learning or an experienced practitioner, the Perceptron Package offers a versatile and easy-to-use tool for your classification needs.

## Features

* Lightweight and efficient implementation of the Perceptron algorithm
* Supports both online and batch learning modes
* Flexible customization options for data preprocessing and feature engineering
* Simple and intuitive API for training and inference
Compatible with Python 3.x

## Installation

You can easily install the Perceptron Package using pip:

```pip install neuronlinear```

## Quick Start
Using the neuronlinear Package is straightforward. Here's a simple example to get you started:

```
from neuronlinear.model import Perceptron, prepare_data


ETA = 0.1 #leaning rate
EPOCHS = 10 #epochs count

# Create a Perceptron object
perceptron = Perceptron(eta=ETA, epochs=EPOCHS)

data = {"x1":[0, 0, 1, 1], "x2" : [0, 1, 0, 1], "y" : [0, 1, 1, 1]}

X, y = prepare_data(data)

perceptron.fit(X, y)
print(f"Prediction for > 0, 1 is {perceptron.predict([0, 1])}")

print(f"Total loss is {model.total_loss}")

```
