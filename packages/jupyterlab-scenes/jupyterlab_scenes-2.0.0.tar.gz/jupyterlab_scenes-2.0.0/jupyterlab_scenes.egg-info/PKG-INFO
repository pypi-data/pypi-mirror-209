# jupyterlab_scenes

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/schmidi314/jupyterlab-scenes/master?urlpath=lab)

Define subsets of code cells as scenes and execute them.

## Usage

* The command "Toggle Scene Cell" attaches a cell to the active scene (or removes it again). Scene membership is indicated by the purple dot at the right end of the cell.
* The active scene is the scene that is currently displayed (purple dots) and can be edited.
* All cells of a scene are executed by clicking the run button in the scene.
* One cell can be part of multiple scenes.

![Basic Usage](https://github.com/schmidi314/jupyterlab-scenes/blob/master/gifs/scenes_basic.gif?raw=true)


* By clicking the `init` button, one scene can be chosen to be automatically executed as the kernel becomes ready (due to a restart or at the initial loading of the notebook).
* If a notebook with an already running kernel is opened, the init scene is __not__ executed.
* Only one scene can be an init scene.

![Initialization](https://github.com/schmidi314/jupyterlab-scenes/blob/master/gifs/scenes_init.gif?raw=true)


* To run a scene named `My Favourite Scene` programatically, do
    ```
    from ipylab import JupyterFrontEnd
    JupyterFrontEnd().commands.execute('scenes:run-scene', 'My Favourite Scene')
    ```
    But you may run only one scene at a time. No excessive looping as the scenes are executed only after the cell that launches the `run-scene` command is finished.
