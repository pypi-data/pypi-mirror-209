# Squarebot

Squarebot is the nexus service for ChatOps and event-driven bots for Rubin Observatory.
As a Slack app, Squarebot receives events from Slack and publishes them into specific _Square Events_ Kafka topics in the [Roundtable Kubernetes cluster](https://phalanx.lsst.io/environments/roundtable-prod/index.html).
Other applications on Roundtable can consume these events and act on them, such as by posting messages back to Slack or by performing some other background automation.

    end
    topicchannel --> backend1

    topicinteraction --> backend2
```

Slack integration is implemented at the time.
We plan to add support for other event sources, such as GitHub, in the future.

Squarebot is built on top of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), a modern Python web framework, with Rubin/SQuaRE libraries [Safir](https://safir.lsst.io) (FastAPI application libraries) and [Kafkit](https://kafkit.lsst.io) (Kafka integration).
