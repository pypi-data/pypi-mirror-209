Language models enable companies to build and launch innovative applications to make their workforce smarter and increase customer satisfaction. 
However, it‚Äôs been known that LLMs can hallucinate, generate adversarial responses that can harm users, and even expose private information that they were trained on when prompted or unprompted. It's more critical than ever for ML and software application teams to minimize these risks and weaknesses before launching LLMs and NLP models. As a result, it‚Äôs important for you to include a process to audit language models thoroughly before production.
The Fiddler Auditor enables you to test LLMs and NLP models, identify weaknesses in the models, and mitigate potential adversarial outcomes before deploying them to production.

## üì∞ Features and Capabilities
Fiddler Auditor supports

- Red-teaming LLMs for your use-case with prompt perturbation
- Integration with LangChain
