<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

### The Reason Behind

The reason behind the the development of this library, was the need turn the old Bosch Control Panel into a smart device without the need to replace it.

Home Assistant is the home automation I use, and I wanted to integrate also the Bosch control panel into it.

Because there wasn't any integration I could use for that purpose, I decided to implement the library myself and use it as dependency for the custom component [bosch_control_panel_cc880](https://github.com/hgomes88/homeassistant/tree/main/custom_components/bosch_control_panel_cc880) also developed by me for Home Assistant.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>


### Interface

Thanks to [this][yes-thomas] webpage, it was possible to figure out that the interface with the control panel can be done through the UART accessible through the auxiliary module pins (see the [UART Pinout](#uart-pinout-and-configuration)).
As mentioned in the website, it is possible to completely replace the [direct link][direct-link-cable] cable usually needed to configure the control panel through the computer using the [A Link Plus][a-link-plus-sw] software.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>


#### Wiring

To sniff and decode the packets supported by the control panel, it was followed the wiring as in the following diagram:

![a-link-plus-usb-diagram]

The information about A-Link Plus can be found [here][a-link-plus-sw].
The USB-TTL converter can be a device similar to [this][usb-ttl-dev].

To make the alarm remotely accessible, it was used a TCP/IP to UART bridge.
The current and tested solution was wired as following:

![esp8266-diagram]

The library `bosch-control-panel-cc880p` is part of this repository.
The `ESP8266` represents any device using that chip such as [ESP1][esp1-dev].
Note that it should be flashed with a software like [ESP-Link][esp-link-sw] to create a bridge between TCP/IP and UART.
Since `ESP1` operates at `3.3V` and `CC880P` control panel operates at `5V`, there's the need to use a level shifter, or something similar (see [this][level-shifter-website] site for examples).


A better solution would be wiring the system as the diagram below:

![elfin-ew10-diagram]

Using a device like [Elfin-EW10][elfin-ew10-dev] would prevent the usage of level shifter as it also operates at `5V`, as well as remove the need to flash any firmware as the device already provides everything needed.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>


##### UART Pinout and Configuration

The pinout of the `CC880P` control panel is:
- `TX`: Auxiliary Module `Pin3` (***Note:*** The [website][yes-thomas] describes the `Pin7` by mistake)
- `RX`: Auxiliary Module `Pin7` (***Note:*** The [website][yes-thomas] describes the `Pin3` by mistake)
- `GND`: Auxiliary Module `Pin4`
- `VCC(5V)`: Auxiliary Module `Pin6`

The baud rate the control panel operates is `300`.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>


#### Protocol

Since there was no information about the protocol used to send commands to the control panel and receive the corresponding responses, the approach was to connect the control panel using the [A Link Plus][a-link-plus-sw] and then sniff and decode the packets being transferred back and forth.
the following steps were followed:

1. Wiring (see [Wiring](#wiring) chapter)
2. Execute the A Link Plus and connect the Alarm (see A Link Plus manual [here][a-link-plus-manual])
3. Monitor and decode the packets (using a software similar to [this][device-monitoring-studio-sw] )

The result is presented in the [frames](#frames) section.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>


##### Frames

Below are presented the decoded frames that are used by this library so far:

9       area        If the alarm is configured to have multiple areas, then
                        this byte identifies the target area that the key(s)
                        will be sent to. Otherwise set it to '00'.

                      - 0x02 if is to disarm the alarm
3-10    XX          Not used and thus, set to 0.
11      crc         Frame checksum (excluding the 1st byte)
```


###### Set Output Command

Command used to set (enable/disable) outputs of the control panel.

```

                        Set Output Off: Set this byte to 0x04
3       out         This byte represents the index of the target output.
                      Supports setting the outputs 1-5, which values in this
                      byte are 0-4 respectively.

###### Get Status Command

Command used to request the overall status of the control panel.
After sending this command is expected the control panel to answer with the [`Get Status Response`](#get-status-response).

                      to get the alarm status. Each digit occupies a nibble.
                      Not used digits should be set to 0xF.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This library provides a CLI (Command Line Interface) to interact with the
control panel.

### Prerequisites

### Installation

The installation of the library, including the CLI, is as simple as run:
```
$ pip install .
```

After that, the library is ready to be used, and now the CLI can be used.
To get help how to use it type in the terminal the following:

```
$ control_panel -h
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

After following the [`Installation`](#installation) section, now the usage of
the CLI can be found by running:
```
$ control_panel -h
usage: control_panel [-h] [-v] -c IP -p PORT {cmd} ...

Connects to the Control Panel

positional arguments:
  {cmd}
    cmd                 Execute a command

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         Gets the current version
  -c IP, --connect IP   the host ip
  -p PORT, --port PORT  the host port
```

There are 2 options to run the CLI as shown in the following sections.

### Run in Listen Mode

In this mode, the script will connect to the control panel in listening only mode, where it will output any kind of change on the control panel.

To run it the minimum should be:

```
$ control_panel -c 192.168.1.22 -p 23
```

### Run in Commanding Mode

This mode, allows the user to send commands to the control panel.
To see the list of available commands the user can do:
```
$ control_panel -c <ip> -p <port> cmd -h
usage: control_panel cmd [-h]  {sendKeys,setMode,setSiren,setOut} ...

positional arguments:
  cmd
  {sendKeys,setMode,setSiren,setOut}
    sendKeys            Sends a set of keys to the control panel. Currently supports the following: [0-9*#]{1,7}
    setMode             Change the control panel mode like arm, disarm, etc
    setSiren            Change the control panel siren status
    setOut              Change the output status of the control panel

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

The following are some examples:

```
$ control_panel -c <ip> -p <port> cmd setSiren off
Before: Siren(on=True)
After: Siren(on=False)
```

```
$ control_panel -c <ip> -p <port> cmd setSiren 1
Before: Siren(on=False)
After: Siren(on=True)
```

```
$ control_panel -c <ip> -p <port> cmd setSiren 1
Before: Siren(on=False)
After: Siren(on=True)
```

```
$ control_panel -c <ip> -p <port> cmd setOut 3 on
Before: Output(on=False)
After: Output(on=True)
```
