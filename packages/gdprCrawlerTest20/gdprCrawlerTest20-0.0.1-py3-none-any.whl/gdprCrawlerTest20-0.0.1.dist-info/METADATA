  <h3 align="center">GDPRxiv Crawler (README)</h3>

  <p align="center">
    An efficient tool to crawl GDPR legal documents!

  </p>
</div>


## About The Project

With the introduction of the Europeans Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), there has been an explosion in the number of legal 
documents pertaining to case reviews, analyses, legal decisions, etc... that mark the enforcement of the GDPR.
Additionally, these documents are spread across over 30 Data Protection (DPA) and Supervisory Authorities. As a result, it is 
cumbersome for researchers/legal teams to access and download a large quantity of GDPR documents at once.

To address this, we have created GDPRxiv Crawler, a command-line tool that allows users to efficiently filter and
download GDPR documents. Users may select their desired DPA and document_type, and GDPRxiv Crawler will scrape the web
and download all up-to-date documents. 

Of course, it is impossible to entirely keep up with DPA website redesigns and newly added document categories. 
However, we hope that this tool will eliminate the bulk of the workload and allow users to focus on more important tasks.



### Built With

* [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
* [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)
* [Add more later...](https://www.example.com)



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Python 3.9 is required. This python version includes the pip installer and the venv module, which is needed to create a 
virtual environment.

It is strongly recommended that users utilize a virtual environment when installing this package. 
See below to create and activate one.

_In a directory:_
1. venv:

    ```sh
    virtualenv <virtual env name>
     ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```sh
    source <virtual env name>/bin/activate
    ```

### Installation
_At any moment, use command 'pip3 list' to view all installed packages._

1. Download [requirements.txt](https://github.com/transientCloud/gdpr-sota/blob/main/pygdpr/requirements.txt)
    and place it in the directory that contains the virtual environment.
2. Install package requirements
   ```sh
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install the GDPRxiv Crawler package
   ```sh
   pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ gdprCrawlerTest15
   ```



## Usage
Downloaded documents will be organized into a set of folders based on DPA and document type.

A file called visitedDocs.txt is always created upon an initial run within a new directory. This file records each downloaded document's
unique hash, which allows the tool to avoid overwriting existing documents (if desired) in future runs. 

* Scrape desired documents:
   ```sh
   gdprCrawler scrape --country <country name> --document_type <document type> --path <directory to store documents>
   ```
    _The same directory can be used for multiple countries: the scraper automatically organizes documents based on country and document type._

* Optionally, the --overwrite argument can be included if users would like to overwrite existing documents:

   ```sh
      gdprCrawler scrape --country <country name> --document_type <document type> --path <directory to store documents> --overwrite <True/False>
   ```
    _Overwrite is False by default._

&nbsp; 

**Country and document type arguments should be written exactly as they appear below:**
