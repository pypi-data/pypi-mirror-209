        ## üí° Introduction
        
        This is the tool that supports the analysis of dependencies for multiple package managers. It detects the manifest file of package managers automatically and analyzes the dependencies with using open source tools. Then, it generates the report file that contains OSS information of dependencies.
        
        
        ## üìñ User Guide
        
        We describe the user guide in the [**FOSSLight Guide page**](https://fosslight.org/fosslight-guide-en/scanner/3_dependency.html).  
        In this user guide, you can see how to install the FOSSLight Dependency Scanner and how to set up the prerequisite step and run it according to the package manager of your project. Also, you can check the results of the FOSSLight Dependency Scanner.
        
        
        ## üßê How to analyze the dependencies
        
        FOSSLight Dependency Scanner utilizes the open source software for analyzing each package manager dependencies. We choose the open source software for each package manager that shows not only the direct dependencies but also the transitive dependencies including the information of dependencies such as oss name, oss version and license name.
        
        Each package manager uses the results of the following software:
        
        - NPM : [NPM License Checker](https://github.com/davglass/license-checker)
        - Pypi : [pip-licenses](https://github.com/raimon49/pip-licenses)
        - Gradle : [License Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/hierynomus/license-gradle-plugin)
        - Maven : [license-maven-plugin](https://github.com/mojohaus/license-maven-plugin)
        - Pub : [flutter_oss_licenses](https://github.com/espresso3389/flutter_oss_licenses)
        - Android(gradle) : [android-dependency-scanning](https://github.com/fosslight/android-dependency-scanning)
        
        Because we utilizes the different open source software to analyze the dependencies of each package manager, you need to set up the **Prerequisite** steps in [User guide](https://fosslight.org/fosslight-guide-en/scanner/3_dependency.html#-prerequisite) according to package manager to analyze.
