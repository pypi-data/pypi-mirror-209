Hostea
======

`Hostea <https://hostea.org/>`__ is a Forgejo hosting service backend. It creates OpenStack virtual machines and installs Forgejo on them, as instructed by an Ansible inventory. It runs from a CI, every time a commit is pushed to the repository containing the Ansible inventory.

In a nutshell it goes like this:

.. code::

    $ git clone git@forgejo.hostea.org:/hostea/fleet
    $ # edit files in fleet
    $ git commit -m 'Created the Forgejo instance foobar'
    $ git push

And go to the CI dashboard to check that it actually does what is expected. In the following it is assumed that Hostea is configured to run from the content of the https://forgejo.hostea.org/hostea/fleet repository and manage Forgejo fleet under the domain name d.hostea.org.

Configuration
-------------

`Hostea <https://hostea.org/>`__ is configured as as documented in `this file
<https://lab.enough.community/main/infrastructure/-/blob/master/playbooks/hostea/roles/hostea/defaults/main.yml>`__
and the values can be modified in the
`~/.enough/example.com/inventory/group_vars/hostea-service-group.yml`
file.

* Clone the repository `git clone git@forgejo.hostea.org:/hostea/fleet`
* Add the `inventory/group_vars/all/domain.yml` file to be something like:

..code::

   domain: example.com

* Add the `inventory/group_vars/all/clouds.yml` with a dedicated OpenStack tenant
* Commit and push


Setting the DNS glue record
---------------------------

Once `Enough` finished installing Hostea, the DNS server is up and ready to answer requests. But the registrar of `example.com` does not know about it and it must be told by creating a Glue Record. See, for instance, how that [can be done for Gandi.net](https://docs.gandi.net/en/domain_names/advanced_users/glue_records.html).

Assuming `git@forgejo.hostea.org:/hostea/fleet` is checked out in `~/.enough/example.com`, it is possible to display the IP of the DNS with:

..code::

    $ enough --domain example.com info
    bind-host ip=51.99.145.50 port=2222

Once this IP is set to be the Glue Record of the `example.com`, all DNS requests will be delegated to it and Hostea will take over.

..note::

    It may take a few hours for the Glue Record to propagate.

Creating a new Forgejo instance
-------------------------------

* pick unique name for the host, for instance hostea001-host
* git clone git@forgejo.hostea.org:/hostea/fleet
* cd hostea
* add the `hosts-scripts/hostea001-host.sh` script with the following:

.. code::

    enough --domain d.hostea.org host create hostea001-host
    enough --domain d.hostea.org service create --host hostea001-host forgejo

* add the `inventory/host_vars/hostea001-host/forgejo.yml` file using `this example <https://lab.enough.community/main/infrastructure/-/blob/master/playbooks/forgejo/roles/forgejo/defaults/main.yml>`__.
* add the `inventory/host_vars/hostea001-host/provision.yml` file to contain one of the following:
  * `openstack_flavor: '{{ openstack_flavor_small }}'` (default)
  * `openstack_flavor: '{{ openstack_flavor_medium }}'`
  * `openstack_flavor: '{{ openstack_flavor_large }}'`
* add the `inventory/hostea001-backup.yml` file with the following:

.. code::

    pets:
      hosts:
        hostea001-host:

* add the `inventory/hostea001-service.yml` file with the following:

.. code::

    forgejo-service-group:
      hosts:
        hosta001-host:
        ansible_port: 2222

* git add .
* git commit -m 'Created hostea001-host`
* git push

Deleting a Forgejo instance
---------------------------

* git clone git@forgejo.hostea.org:/hostea/fleet
* cd hostea
* remove the directory `inventory/host_vars/hostea001-host`
* remove the file `inventory/hostea001-backup.yml`
* remove the file `inventory/hostea001-service.yml`
* edit the `hosts-scripts/hostea001-host.sh` script with the following:

.. code::

    enough --domain d.hostea.org host delete hostea001-host

* git add .
* git commit -m 'Deleted hostea001-host`
* git push
