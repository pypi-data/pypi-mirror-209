# branlba/shogun

A collection of loosely integrated Python utilities intended to assist in embedded software development, centered around building/flashing/testing code. It is very much tailored to my specific workflow and use cases, however I've tried to design in in such a way that it is usable by a more general audience should anyone find it useful.

## Installation

Simply install with pip, run

`pip install -e .`

from the repository root. I may put this on PyPi at some point, but it's better to include this as a git submodule or just copy it into the project directly.
