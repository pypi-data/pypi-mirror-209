# diarisation-metrics

This repository is Speechmatics' fork of https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-metrics. We have changed the project to fit our python project template.
## Getting Started
### Wheel

This project is built as a Python wheel by the CI. To download and use an existing wheel, get the latest version of `sm_diarisation_metrics` from Artifactory. e.g.

```
$ pip3 install --extra-index-url https://artifacts.speechmatics.io/speechmatics/api/pypi/pypi-master/simple sm_diarisation_metrics
```

This package has a CLI supporting ctm, lab, or V2 JSON format that can be run using eg
`python3 -m sm_diarisation_metrics.cookbook reference.json transcript.json`
### Docs

To build the docs run `make docs`. This will create a directory containing HTML docs under `docs/build/html`. Run `make serve-docs` to run a web server to serve these docs locally at http://localhost:8080.
### Command line interface

For convenience we have created `aladdin.diarization.metrics.sm_diarisation_metrics.cookbook` which features a simplified
CLI for the most common tasks that we need to perform at Speechmatics for evaluating diarisation.

Currently this CLI just offers one interface which accepts a reference and hypothesis diarisation
data file in either ctm, lab, or V2 JSON format and returns the diarisation error rate.
To use this run for example `python3 -m aladdin.diarization.metrics.sm_diarisation_metrics.cookbook ref.ctm hyp.lab`.
### Tests

Run the unit tests with `make test`.
