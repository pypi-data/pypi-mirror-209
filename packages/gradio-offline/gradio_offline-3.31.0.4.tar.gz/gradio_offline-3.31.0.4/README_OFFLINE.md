# Gradio Offline

Use gradio without internet connection. This repo tracks [the official repo](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) until it supports offline mode.

## Install

```shell
pip install gradio-offline
```

Usage is the same as using `gradio`.

:warning: This repo is designed to make minimal changes to enable the offline usage of gradio.
