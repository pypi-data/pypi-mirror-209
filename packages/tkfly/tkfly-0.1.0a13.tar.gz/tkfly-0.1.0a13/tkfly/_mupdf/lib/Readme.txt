README
------

Within this package, under the lib directory, auxiliary packages are provided
 * snit-2.3.2

When integrating this package in a larger app, you can move them in a common 
shared "lib" directory

- Thanks to SVN, these libs are not duplicated; they are refrerenced
  through svn:externals
