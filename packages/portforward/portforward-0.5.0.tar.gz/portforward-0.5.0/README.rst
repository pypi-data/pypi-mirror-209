Kubernetes Port-Forward Go-Edition For Python


* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://portforward.readthedocs.io.


Installation
-----------------------------

The following things are required when there is no wheel available for the target system.

* `Go` installed and available in the path (at least v1.16 / https://go.dev)
* `Python` (at least v3.6 - below was never tested but might work)
* `gcc` (for Windows available via MinGW)

Pip knows how to install ``portforward``.

.. code-block::

    pip install portforward


Quickstart
----------

.. code-block:: Python

    import requests

    import portforward


    def main():
        namespace = "test"
        pod_name = "web"  # You can also use a service name instead
        local_port = 9000  # from port
        pod_port = 80  # to port

        # No path to kube config provided - will use default from $HOME/.kube/config
        with portforward.forward(namespace, pod_name, local_port, pod_port):
            response = requests.get("http://localhost:9000")
            print(f"Done: \n'{response.status_code}'\n'{response.text[:20]}...'")


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()


Features
--------

* Go native Kubernetes port-forwarding with the ``.kube/config`` from the home dir
  or any other path to config.
* Portforward for pods and services - the lib will first look for a pod with matching name then for
  a service
* Waiting for a pod to become ready


Development
-----------

In case you want to develop on this library itself please take a look at the CONTRIBUTING page.
