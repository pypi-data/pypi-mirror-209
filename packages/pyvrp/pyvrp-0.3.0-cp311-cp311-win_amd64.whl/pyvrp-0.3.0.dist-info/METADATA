# PyVRP

The `pyvrp` package is an open-source, state-of-the-art vehicle routing problem solver.

`pyvrp` may be installed in the usual way as
```
pip install pyvrp
```
This also resolves the few core dependencies `pyvrp` has.
The documentation is available [here][1].

> If you are new to metaheuristics or vehicle routing, you might benefit from reading the [introduction to HGS for VRP][6] page.

### Examples

We provide some example notebooks that show how the `pyvrp` package may be used to solve vehicle routing problems.
These include:

- The vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW), [here][4].
  We solve several instances from the literature, including a large 1000 customer instance.
- The capacitated vehicle routing problem, [here][5].
  We solve an instance with 439 customers to near optimality within 30 seconds.
