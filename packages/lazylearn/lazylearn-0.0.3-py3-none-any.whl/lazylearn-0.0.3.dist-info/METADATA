Summary: lazy-learn is a high-level Python interface for automated machine learning (AutoML) for the lazy data scientist. While there are many AutoML libraries available each typically solves a niche area of the overall ML pipeline without providing a covering and approachable end-to-end system. lazy-learn aims at providing the most approachable and fastest access to building baseline models.

**lazy-learn** is a high-level Python interface for automated machine learning (AutoML). While there are many AutoML libraries available each typically solves a niche area of the overall ML pipeline without providing a covering and approachable end-to-end system.

The aim of lazy-learn is exactly that. Given a dataset, easy-learn will analyse types and distributions of attributes, preprocess, feature-engineer and ultimately train models to be used for further evaluation or inference. 

## Upcoming features

Current stable version is 0.0.3. The upcoming updates will support:
- Abstract construction of model architectures
- XGBoost, LightGBM, Adaboost and Catboost architectures
- Time partitioning of datasets
- Automated Hyperparameter Optimisation (HPO)
- Text features
- An interface to AutoGluon
- Outlier detection and handling
- Automated suggestions of performance metrics

## Usage

Using lazy-learn revolves around the `LazyLearner` class. You can think of it as a kind of project, and it is the wrapper for any experiment within lazy-learn.
