These devices allow users to quickly, easily and reliably add custom 
behavioral, nonlinear system models to the circuit and RF system simulator 
in the Advanced Design System, by describing the output spectral component(s)
in terms of arbitrary functions of the input spectral components.
* Users define spectral port voltages and currents as functions of other 
  spectral voltages and currents.
* No C-coding or compilation is required.
* Derivatives are generated automatically by the simulator.
* Some models may not be meaningful in some analysis types.
* Models with time-domain triggering capability can be created.

IQ_modulator is a simple, ideal I-Q modulator implemented with an FDD.
IQmodTest simulates the I-Q modulator with baseband sine and cosine 
  signals at two different magnitudes (0 and 0.95.)
FDDmixer is a relatively simple model of an ideal mixer.  It models 
  upconversion, downconversion, LO leakage, RF leakage, and conversion
  gain compression with increasing LO signal amplitude.
FDDmixerTest is a harmonic balance simulation of the mixer.  It shows
  the output spectrum as well as the conversion gain.
FDDmixerTestEnv simulates the mixer with Circuit Envelope.  In this 
  case, the input signal is a carrier with upper and lower sidebands,
  and the mixer is configured to act as a frequency doubler. 
HarmSrc shows how to generate a pulsed signal that is the sum of 
  harmonics, using harmonic indexing.
DFlipFlop is a simple, behavioral model implemented with an FDD.
DFlipFlopSim simulates the flip flop with logic and clock input signals.
SampleHold simulates a simple sample and hold implemented with an FDD.
DynamicTherm_Amp simulates an amplifier with gain that is reduced as 
  a function of the heat that is dissipated within it.
testRC just simulates the RC filter that models the ability of the
  heat sink to dissipate heat.`
