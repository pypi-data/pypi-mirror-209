These devices allow users to quickly, easily and reliably add custom 
nonlinear models to the circuit and RF system simulator in the 
Advanced Design System.
* Users define port voltages and currents as functions of other voltages
  and currents.
* No C-coding or compilation is required.
* Derivatives are generated automatically by the simulator.

SDD_cap is a simple, voltage-dependent 
  capacitor model.
SDD_cap2 is a similar voltage-dependent
  capacitor model, that behaves identically.
Test_SDD_cap simulates the  
  capacitance versus bias voltage.
* No need to learn how to "load the matrix".
* One set of equations is used for all analysis types, including DC,
  AC, S-parameter, harmonic balance, and Circuit Envelope.

Cubic is a simple, third-order nonlinear "resistor" implemented 
  with an SDD.  The I-V curve as well as the current spectrum and
  time-domain waveform are simulated.
SDD_Diode is a diode modeled with an SDD.  This model can be used to 
  model a varactor diode, also.
TestDiode simulates the bias-dependent capacitance of the SDD_Diode.
selfHeatingDiode  shows how to include a diode's self-heating in its
model.
Test_selfHeatingDiode performs a DC simulation to get the I-V curve
which includes the effect of the junction temperature.
NonlinearAmp is an ideal amplifier modeled with a two-port SDD.  The 
  user can set input and output resistances, small-signal gain, and
  saturated output voltage.
TestAmp simulates the DC input-output voltage characteristic as well
  as the compression characteristic of the NonlinearAmp.
IdealMixer simulates an ideal mixer (really a voltage multiplier)
  with a three port SDD.
RemCC is an example of a controlling current used in an SDD.  The
  voltage at the output of an SDD is a function of the current in a
  voltage source.  A voltage is generated that is equal to the 
  instantaneous power dissipated in a resistor.
Sine simulates an SDD implementation of an ideal VCO.  An FM signal
  is applied to the control voltage input, and the time-domain
  signal and spectrum are plotted.
VCObd is a block diagram of a VCO, but it is not simulated.
WeightLPF is an example that shows how to define several weighting
  functions.  These functions allow the user to define equations with
  derivatives and more complicated expressions.
RecConv shows a pulse driving a low-pass filter, implemented via a 
  polynomial.  Recursive convolution, which
  handles frequency responses with polynomials more efficiently in the
  time domain, is used in the simulation.
GumPoon implements a Gummel-Poon BJT model via an SDD.
GumPoon_DCtest simulates the DC I-V curves of the device.
GilCellMix is a Gilbert cell mixer implemented with the SDD Gummel-Poon
  model (although the biasing resistors have not been optimized so the 
  mixer does not have good conversion gain.)
MixHBTest is a simple harmonic balance simulation of the Gilbert cell
  mixer.

SDD_cap is a simple, voltage-dependent capacitor model. SDD_cap2 is a similar
voltage-dependent capacitor model, that behaves identically. Test_SDD_cap 
simulates the capacitance versus bias voltage.`
