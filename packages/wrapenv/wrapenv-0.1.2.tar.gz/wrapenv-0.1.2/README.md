# WrapEnv

An environment that can hold several callable functions along with pre- and post-processing
functions and auxilary environment. It is intended to be used as a wrapper for a function that
is to be called in a different environment than the one it was defined in.

## Installation

As usual, you can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install wrapenv
```
