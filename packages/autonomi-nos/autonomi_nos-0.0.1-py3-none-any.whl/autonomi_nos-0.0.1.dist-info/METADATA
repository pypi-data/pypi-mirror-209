**NOS** is a PyTorch library for optimizing and running lightning-fast inference of popular computer vision models. NOS inherits its name from "Nitrous Oxide System", the performance-enhancing system typically used in racing cars. NOS is designed to be modular and easy to extend.

## Why NOS?
- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Fast**: NOS is built on top of PyTorch and is designed to run models faster.
- üî• **Out-of-the-box Performance**: Run stable diffusion or object detection in under 5 lines, 2-3x faster than vanilla PyTorch.
- üë©‚Äçüíª **Reduce barrier-to-entry**: NOS is designed to be easy to use. No ML optimizations or compilers knowledge necessary.
- üì¶ **Modular**: NOS is designed to be modular and easy to extend. Optimize Pytorch models in a few lines of code.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **HW-accelerated:** NOS is designed to leverage hardware-acceleration down to the metal (GPUs, TPUs, ASICs etc).
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud-agnostic:** NOS is designed to run on any cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure, Lambda Labs, on-prem, etc.).

## Batteries Included
 - üí™ **SOTA Model Support:** NOS comes with support for popular CV models such as Stable Diffusion, ViT, CLIP, and more.
 - üê≥ **Docker:** NOS comes with optimized docker images for accelerated CV workloads (runtime libs, drivers, optimized models).
 - üîå **Interfaces:** NOS comes with a REST/gRPC API out-of-the-box to help you use your models.
 - üìà **Benchmarks**: NOS comes with a suite of benchmarks to help you compare performance of your models.

## Hardware Support
We currently plan to support the following hardware:
 - [ ] GPU (NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs)
   - [ ] AWS (g4/g5dn/p3/p4dn)
   - [ ] GCP (g2/a1/n1)
 - [ ] AWS Inferentia inf1/inf2
 - [ ] Intel Habana Gaudi
 - [ ] Google TPUv3


## Lint
```bash
make lint  # Runs all the linters using ruff/pre-commit
```

## Test
```bash
make test  # Runs all the basic tests using pytest
```

## Benchmark
```bash
make test-benchmarks  # Runs all the benchmarks setting NOS_TEST_BENCHMARK=1
```

## Contribute
We welcome contributions! Please see our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.
