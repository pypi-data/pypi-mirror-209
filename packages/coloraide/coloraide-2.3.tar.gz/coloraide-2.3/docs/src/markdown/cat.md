# Chromatic Adaptation

Chromatic adaptation is the human visual system's ability to adjust to changes in illumination in order to preserve the
appearance of object colors. It is responsible for the stable appearance of object colors despite the wide variation of
light which might be reflected from an object and observed by our eyes. A chromatic adaptation transform (CAT) emulates
this important aspect of color perception in color appearance models.

In short, colors look different under different lighting, and CATs are used to predict what a color should look like
from one lighting source to another.

## Illuminants

Viewing a color in daylight will look different than viewing it by candle light. Color spaces usually define a reference
illuminant that clarifies the assumed lighting for the given space. For instance, sRGB is a color space defined with an
illuminant of D65 (light in the shade - no direct sunlight - at noon). On the other hand, the ProPhoto RGB space uses a
D50 illuminant (direct sunlight at noon).

When translating a color from one illuminant to another, it is often desirable to represent that color under the new
illuminant such that it appears to the eye the same as it did under the original illuminant. CATs are used to predict
what the new color under the new illuminant should be in order to fulfill these requirements.

For a quick example, we can demonstrate the basic principle when translating a color in the XYZ color space from a D50
illuminant to a D65 illuminant. Below, we can see that the colors look pretty much the same, even though they are now
described under different illuminants.

```py play
d50 = Color('color(xyz-d50 0.11627 0.07261 0.23256 / 1)')
d65 = d50.convert('xyz-d65')
d50, d65
```

These transforms are usually designed for the XYZ color space as it operates in linear light making it the ideal place
to apply the transform. Any color that must go through a CAT to account for differences in illuminants must pass through
the XYZ color space. More specifically, ColorAide requires the color to pass through XYZ D65 space as that will trigger
the chromatic adaptation. For instance, if a color space such as ProPhoto is being translated to sRGB, ProPhoto will
first be transformed to XYZ D50, then XYZ D65 which will trigger the chromatic adaptation, next to Linear sRGB, and
lastly sRGB.

So, we can actually do this manually and compare the results to what we did above. In order to do this, we need to
provide the specified "white point" for the source color and the "white point" for the destination color along with the
XYZ coordinates we wish to transform. ColorAide uses the Bradford CAT by default, so we will specify that CAT for
consistency.

```py play
from coloraide import cat
Color('color(xyz-d50 0.11627 0.07261 0.23256 / 1)').convert('xyz-d65')[:-1]
Color.chromatic_adaptation(cat.WHITES['2deg']["D50"], cat.WHITES['2deg']["D65"], [0.11627, 0.07261, 0.23256], method='bradford')
```

ColorAide, currently defines the following illuminants for both 2˚ observer and 10˚ observer, but most people are
probably only concerned with D65 and D50 (2˚ degree observer) which are the only the illuminants used in the default
color spaces provided by ColorAide.

Illuminants |
----------- |
`A`         |
`B`         |
`C`         |
`D50`       |
`D55`       |
`D65`       |
`D75`       |
`E`         |
`F2`        |
`F7`        |
`F11`       |

## Supported CATs

There are various CATs, all varying in complexity and accuracy. We will not go through all of them and instead will
leave that up to the user to research as needed. Suffice it to say, the Bradford CAT is currently the industry standard
(in most cases), but there are a variety of options available, and research continues to try and improve upon CATs of
the past to come up with better CATs for the future.

Currently, ColorAide mainly supports von Kries type CATs (named after an early 20th century color scientist), or CATs
that are similar to and/or are built upon the original von Kries CAT. We also do not currently support every known von
Kries CAT out there, but a good number are available. In the future, support may be expanded.

CAT           |
------------- |
`bradford`    |
`von-kries`   |
`xyz-scaling` |
`sharp`       |
`cat02`       |
`cat16`       |
`cmccat97`    |
`cmccat2000`  |

## Changing the Default CAT

Changing the default CAT is easy and follows the same pattern as the rest of the
[available class overrides](./color.md#override-default-settings). Simply derive a new `#!py3 Color()` class from the
original and override the `CHROMATIC_ADAPTATION` property with the [name of the desired CAT](#supported-cats).
Afterwards, all color transforms will use the specified CAT.

```py play
class Custom(Color):
    CHROMATIC_ADAPTATION = 'cat02'

d50 = Custom('color(xyz-d50 0.11627 0.07261 0.23256 / 1)')
d65 = d50.convert('xyz-d65')
d50, d65
```
