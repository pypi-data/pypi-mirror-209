Typically, it's not necessary to examine this folder directly. This directory contains the main core of solvers and dynamical runners that you can call, and their codes are available for modification. By default, there are some practical classes such as the LTI runner, nonlinear runner for ODEs, and the creation of neural networks with neuron dynamical formulas. Additionally, the 'lib' folder contains classes that include necessary functions used in the framework structure.
