Description: binvox
        =======
        
        Binvox is a file-format developed by Patrick Min that helps to store
        the 3D binary-volume (e.g. occupancy grid) in compact manner. 
        This repository contains a library for loading &amp; saving the Binvox files.
        
        A popular script to load/save binvox files has been published
        at `here <https://github.com/dimatura/binvox-rw-py>`_. However, the code is
        almost 10 years old now and every project duplicated the script file
        when using it.
        
        This project is based on the available code-base. The main aim is to
        re-implement binvox file I/O as a library while taking OOP structure and
        easy distribution (packaging) into account.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Pip can be used to install the library:
        
        ``pip install binvox``
