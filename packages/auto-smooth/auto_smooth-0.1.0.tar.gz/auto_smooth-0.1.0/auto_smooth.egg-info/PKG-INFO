Apply data smoothing/filtering to a time series by automatically selecting parameters.

Currently available smoothing/filtering techniques in the package:
- Savitzky–Golay filter 

## Quickstart

```python
from auto_smooth import auto_savgol

# apply savgol filter
data_filtered = auto_savgol(data)

>>> wl_best=7, po_best=2
```

## Savitzky-Golay Filtering

Savitzky–Golay (Abraham Savitzky and Marcel J. E. Golay) filter is a type of low-pass filter used for smoothing noisy data.[^1] It is based on local least-squares fitting.[^2]

`auto_savgol` method applies a Savitzky–Golay filter using the [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.savgol_filter.html) `savgol_filter()` method.


```python
from auto_smooth import auto_savgol

# apply savgol filter
data_filtered = auto_savgol(data)

# pass window-length and polynomial-order arguments
data_filtered = auto_savgol(data, wl_min=10, wl_max=30, po_min=2, po_max=10)
```
