Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!
Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

## Environment setup

Nothing easier!

Fork and clone the repository, then:

```bash
cd pymultiastar
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Development

As usual:

1. create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature-or-bugfix-name`
2. edit the code and/or the documentation

Then create a pull request!
