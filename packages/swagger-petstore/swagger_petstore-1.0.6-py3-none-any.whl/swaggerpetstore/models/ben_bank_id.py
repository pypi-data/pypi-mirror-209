    This group consists of all possible beneficiary bank identifier types. The

    The 'merchantBankID' is an optional merchant specified identifier for the
    beneficiary bank account. The 'epBankID', 'merchantBankID' or both
    'epBankID' and 'merchantBankID' can be supplied. A mapping will be
    performed to retrieve the merchant bank ID from the supplied EP bank ID
    and vice versa. If both the 'epBankID' and 'merchantBankID' are supplied,
    a check will be performed to ensure that the two are mapped. If the two
    provided fields are not mapped, then a validation error code will be
    returned. At least one of the fields must be populated.
