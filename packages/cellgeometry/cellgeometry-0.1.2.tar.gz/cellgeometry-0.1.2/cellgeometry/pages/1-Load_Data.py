## Getting Started

We currently support an ROI zip folder created by FIJI/ImageJ. What this means is you may have a folder structure as follows:
```
    â””â”€â”€ Cropped_Images
        â”œâ”€â”€ Bottom_plank_0
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Averaged_ROI
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Data
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Data_Filtered
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Labels
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ OG
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Outlines
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ROIs  <---- Folder of zipped ROIs
```
You can simply upload this ROIs folder and we will load your data for you. We plan on supporting data given in `xy` coordinate format from `JSON` and CSV/TXT files.
Your chosen data structure __must__ contain `x` and `y` for the program to correctly parse and load your data.
