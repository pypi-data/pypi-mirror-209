Locations

Locations are used to organize Webex Calling (BroadCloud) features within physical locations. Webex Control Hub may be
used to define new locations.

Searching and viewing locations in your organization requires an administrator auth token with the
spark-admin:people_read and spark-admin:people_write or spark-admin:device_read AND spark-admin:device_writescope
combinations.
