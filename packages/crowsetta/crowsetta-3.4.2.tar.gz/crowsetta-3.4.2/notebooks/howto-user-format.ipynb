    "## Case Study: the `BatLAB` format\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you work in the Schumacher lab, studying bat vocalizations. The lab research specialist, Alfred, has spent years writing an application in Labview to capture bat calls, called `SoNAR` (\"Sound and Neural Activity Recorder\"). Alfred has also written a GUI in MATLAB called `BatLAB` that lets you interactively annotate audio files containing the bats' calls, and saves the annotations in `.mat` (MATLAB data) files.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've started to work with Python to analyze your data, because you like the data science and machine learning libraries. However, you find yourself writing the same code over and over again to unpack the annotations from the `.mat` files made by `BatLAB`. Every time you use the code for a new analysis, you have to modify it slightly. The code has some weird, hard-to-read lines to deal with the complicated MATLAB `struct`s created by `BatLAB` and how they load into Python. The code also has several repetitive steps to deal with the idiosyncracies of how `SoNAR` and `BatLAB` save data: unit conversion, data types, etcetera. You can't change `BatLAB` or `SoNAR` though, because that's Alfred's job, and everyone else's code that was written ten years ago (and still works!) expects those idiosyncracies.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know that it's a good idea to turn the code you wrote into a function (because you took part in a [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) workshop and then you read [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510).) You figured out which bits of the code will be common to all your projects and you make that into a function, called `parse_batlab_mat`. At first you just copy and paste it into all your projects. Then you decide you also want to save everyone else in your lab the effort of writing the same code, so you put the script on your lab's Github page. This is a step in the right direction, although `parse_batlab_mat` gives you back a Python `list` of `dict`s, and you end up typing a lot of things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "labels = annot_list[0]['seg_type']\n",
    "onsets = annot_list[0]['seg_onsets']\n",
    "offsets = annot_list[0]['seg_offsets']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Typing all those very similar `['keys']` in particular gets kind of annoying and makes you wonder if you should spend your vacation learning how to use one of those hacker text editors like `vim`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before you can worry about that, you get back reviews of your paper in *PLOS Comp. Bio.* called \"Pidgeon Bat: Emergence of Dialects in Colonies of Multiple Bat Species\". Reviewer #3 doesn't buy your conclusions (and you are pretty sure from the way they write that it is Oswald Cobblepot, professor emeritus of ethology at Metropolitan University of Fruitville, Florida, and author of the seminal review from 1982, \"Bat Calls: A Completely Innate Behavior Encoded Genetically\"). You want to share your data with the world, mainly to mollify reviewer #3. The problem is that this reviewer (if he is who you think he is) only knows how to write Fortran code and is definitely not going to figure out how to copy and use your function `parse_batlab_mat` so he can run your analysis scripts and reproduce your figures for himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you really want is to share your data and write your code in a way that doesn't depend on anyone knowing anything about `BatLAB` or`SoNAR` and how those programs save data and annotations. This is where `crowsetta` comes to your rescue."

    "How does that work? Well, as long as we can convert our annotation format to `Sequence`s, then we can pass those `Sequence`s to the `crowsetta.csv2seq` function, which will output them as a `.csv` file. The `Transcriber` does this by default. Under the hood, when you make a new `Transcriber` with your `user_config`, it wraps your `format2seq` function and the `seq2csv` function into one, using the function `crowsetta.csv.toseq_func_to_csv`."
