# ARGUMENTS

Be aware that valid can also mean implicit notes, that is, pointing to a
current-day note just by its notebook name. For example, if today is
2023-04-04 and you have a notebook containing a 2023-04-04.age note,
simply pointing to the notebook's name, e.g. `halig edit notebook` will
edit the 2023-04-04.age note. Also keep in mind that the note may or may
not exist and it'll be created accordingly; the only requirement is that
the notebook folder structure is correct and exists"""
