## Download and install


If you are using `PyPI` run the following promt in terminal:

```
pip install pydivision
```

You can also test the unstable version of the package with:

```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pydivision
```

## Quick start

The package contains functions to make a division, check if two numbers are divisible and ...

For instance:

```
import midivision
print(midivision.division(1,2))  #0.5
```

## Code examples

#### division

    Return the division between two numbers

    Args:
    -    a : Numerator
    -    b : Denominator
        type_ (, optional): Type of result, possible values are "complex","str","int" and "float". Defaults to float.

    Returns:
    -    a/b: Result of division in expected type
    
For instance:

```
import midivision
print(midivision.division(1,2,"complex")) $0.5 + 0j
```

#### isdivisble

    Args:
        a : Numerator
        b : Denominator

    Returns:
        True if a is divisible by b, else False

For instance:

```
import midivision
print(midivision.isdivisible(5,5)) # True
```


Version 0.2:

- Functions `division` and  `isdivisible`  was implemented.

Version 0.1:

- First version of the package.
