1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I don't have to remind many Americans that the
Center for Disease Control was the one that said
you should use DDT in your homes.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Used right, it is absolutely harmless to humans
and animals.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Remember the name, DDT.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A scientific panel today reported that pesticides
may indeed represent a grave threat to mankind.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Remember the swine flu scare of 1976?

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That was the year the U.S. government told us all
that swine flu could turn out to be a killer,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and Washington decided that every man, woman, and
child in the nation should get a shot to prevent a
nationwide outbreak, a pandemic.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Well, 46 million of us obediently took the shot.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Did anyone ever come to you and say there's the
possibility of neurological damage if you get into
a mass immunization program?

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
No.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
No one ever did?

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
No.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I can't believe that they would say that they did
not know that there were neurological illnesses
associated with influenza vaccination.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That simply is not true. We did know that.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And he's lying.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I guess you would have to make that assumption.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Then why does this report from your own agency
list neurological complications as a possibility?

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You didn't feel it was necessary to tell the
American people that information.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Dr. Sensor's CDC also helped create the
advertising to get the public to take the shot.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The vaccines are safe, so roll up your sleeve.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And now Americans are claiming damages from Uncle
Sam amounting to three and a half billion dollars.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
By far the greatest number of the claims,
two-thirds of them, are for neurological damage or
even death.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:51,000
There are serious concerns tonight about how well
the CDC controls dangerous germs at its own labs
after yet another safety lapse.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
For the third time in a month, the CDC
acknowledged deadly pathogens were handled
incorrectly in government labs.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That CDC is the CDC that allegedly is looking out
for your public health.
