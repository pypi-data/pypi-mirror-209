# Shipyard Jira
Shipyard Jira is a Python library that provides a convenient interface for interacting with the Jira issue tracking system. It simplifies the process of managing Jira issues, allowing users to create, update, and query issues programmatically.

## Installation
```bash
pip install shipyard-jira
```
## Create an API token
Create an API token from your Atlassian account:

**STEP 1.** Log in to https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens.

**STEP 2.** Click Create API token.

**STEP 3.** From the dialog that appears, enter a memorable and concise Label for your token and click Create.

**STEP 4.** Click Copy to clipboard, then paste the token to your script, or elsewhere to save:
 
**_NOTE:_** 

* For security reasons it isn't possible to view the token after closing the creation dialog; if necessary, create a new token.
* You should store the token securely, just as for any password.
