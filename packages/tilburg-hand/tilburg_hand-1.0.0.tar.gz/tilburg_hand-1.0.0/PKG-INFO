The tilburg-hand repository contains the main Python library used to control the [Tilburg Hand](https://www.tilburg-robotics.eu). The repository also includes documentation, examples, a motor gui (installed as `tilburg_hand_motorgui`), and urdf + Mujoco xml models for the robot.

<br/>
Required libraries:<br/>
- dynamixel_sdk<br/>
- pyserial<br/>
- Tk (for the motor gui)<br />


## Installation

Install the library using `pip`, either download one of the pre-built packages, or from PyPI (`pip install tilburg-hand`), or directly from this repository (`pip install -e .` for in-path installation).
