A lightweight python library for keeping track of, and optimizing, configuration and results for digital experiments.

## Getting Started

Installation is as easy as `pip install digital-experiments`

Using the library is easy too. Here's a simple example:

```python
from digital_experiments import experiment

@experiment
def my_experiment(a, b=2):
    return a ** b

my_experiment(2, b=3)
```

## Walkthrough

The [examples directory](examples/) contains some notebooks that help explain how this package works
