A simple rsync-based backup solution for unix systems.

`rsbackup` is a simple python application that uses `rsync` to create backups with support for hard links on
incremental backups.

# Installation

`rsbackup` requires a working installation of Python 3.10 and the `rsync` command line tool. `rsbackup` uses only `rsync` flags
supported on both Linux and BSD versions (i.e. MacOS) of `rsync`.

Use the following command to install `rsbackup`:

```shell
pip install rsbackup
```

# Usage

`rsbackup` reads backup configurations from a configuration [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) file. The default 
filename to read is `$HOME/.config/rsbackup.toml` but you can specify a different file using the `-c` cli 
switch.

The config file contains multiple backup configurations. It looks something like this

```toml
[projects]
description = 'All dev projects'
source = '/home/user/projects'
target = '/mnt/backup'
excludes = [
  '__pycache__/',
]
```

See [`rsbackup.toml`](./rsbackup.toml) for a documented example.

Each TOML `table` (i.e. each section header) defines a single backup configuration. The header contains
the config's name. This is used as a command line argument to create a backup so pick something that needs no
shell escaping.

Each table contains the following keys:

Key | Type | Optional | Description
-- | -- | -- | --
`description` | string | yes | contains an optional description.
`sources` | array of string | no | lists the source directories to create a backup of
`target` | string | no | contains a target directory which will eventualy contain multiple backups
`excludes` | array of strings | yes | lists patterns to be excluded from the backup. See the `rsync` documentation for a description of the pattern format.

You can use

```shell
rsbackup list
```

to get a list of all backup configurations.

To create a backup, run

```shell
rsbackup create <name of the config>
```

This will create a new directory named after the timestamp (in seconds) inside the target to contain the
backup. 

If you run `rsbackup create` with the testconfiguration provided in [`rsbackup.toml`](./rsbackup.toml) you
will get the following backup under `tmp`:

```
tmp
├── 2022-05-19_15-08-25
│   └── rsbackup
│       ├── config.py
│       ├── config_test.py
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── __main__.py
│       ├── rsbackup_test.py
│       ├── rsync.py
│       └── rsync_test.py
└── _latest -> /home/alex/Development/python/backup/tmp/2022-05-19_15-08-25
```

Of course, the name of the backup directory will depend on the local time you execute the backup. Notice that
no `__pycache__` directory is contained in the backup as it is excluded. 

`rsbackup` provides the following command line options

Option | Default Value | Description
-- | -- | --
`-h`, `--help` | - | display a help message
`-c CONFIG_FILE`, `--config-file CONFIG_FILE` | `$HOME/.config/rsbackup.yaml` | path of the config file
`-m`, `--dry-run` | - |  enable dry run; do not touch any files but output commands instead
`--no-link-latest` | - | skip linking unchanged files to latest copy (if exists)

# Development

You need Python >= 3.9 to run and thus develop. `tomli` is used to load TOML files. `pytest` is used to 
execute unit and acceptance tests. `setuptools` is used as a [PEP517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/)
build backend. 

`requirements.txt` only contains the minimal set of dependencies to install the application, so it only 
contains `tomli`.
